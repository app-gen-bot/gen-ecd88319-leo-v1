You are the Lead Engineer + Product Owner of “AI College Counselor,” an end-to-end web platform that replicates and augments real college counseling and admissions advising. Build it autonomously from scratch. Objectives: (1) Student intake & profile builder (academics, courses, grades, test scores, activities, awards, interests, constraints, budget, geography, learning preferences); (2) College discovery & fit modeling (reach/target/safety tiers, program strength, culture, outcomes, costs, aid likelihood); (3) Deadline & requirement tracker (per school: portals, due dates by time zone, rec letters, portfolios, interviews, testing, financial aid forms); (4) Essay planner & coach (prompt selection, story mining, outlines, drafts, revision suggestions, plagiarism checking, source acknowledgment, tone guidance, rubric-based feedback); (5) Application strategy (early vs. regular, major selection considerations, scholarship strategy, gap-year/transfer paths); (6) Interview prep (question bank, mock interviews, feedback); (7) Financial aid & scholarships (COA, EFC/SAI estimator, net-price modeling, merit/need opportunities, reminders); (8) Calendar & notifications (email/SMS/push, guardrails to avoid spam, ICS export); (9) Progress dashboard for students/parents, with counselor/admin console; (10) Human-in-the-loop escalation for sensitive decisions. Deliverables: a production-grade, documented repository with (a) backend (REST/GraphQL) services, (b) frontend (responsive, accessible), (c) data layer & schemas, (d) background jobs for crawling public deadline pages, (e) integration stubs for calendars/email/SMS/cloud storage, (f) prompt library & evaluation harness for LLM tasks, (g) unit/integration/e2e tests, (h) seed data & mocks, (i) CI/CD pipeline, (j) observability (logs, metrics, tracing, uptime alerts), (k) analytics (funnel, retention, feature usage), (l) security & privacy hardening, (m) deployment IaC, (n) project docs (README, runbook, architecture). Constraints & ethics: do not scrape or automate login to private/paid portals; only use publicly available data and cite sources; include accuracy checks, uncertainty handling, and bias mitigation; provide plain-language disclaimers that AI is advisory, not a decision-maker; support FERPA/CCPA/GDPR-aligned data practices, parental controls for minors, and data export/delete; WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility; multilingual UX (at least English + Spanish); secure-by-default (HTTPS, OAuth/OIDC, RBAC, secrets management, encryption at rest/in transit, least-privilege); guard against hallucinations with retrieval (public datasets like IPEDS/College Scorecard where permitted), source links, and “verify” buttons; never fabricate deadlines—fetch, parse, and show source URLs with timestamps and confidence; rate-limit and abuse protections. Architecture & stack (choose sensible defaults and justify): propose a modular service architecture (auth, student-profile, college-knowledge, deadlines-ingestor, planner, essay-coach, interview-coach, finances, notifier, admin); use vector search/RAG for policies/prompts/rubrics; define clear tool interfaces for the AI agent (search, scrape-public, extract-structured, write-file, run-tests, deploy). Data modeling: design normalized schemas for Student, Guardian, Counselor, AcademicRecord, Activity, TestScore, College, Program, Requirement, Deadline, Essay, Recommendation, Interview, Scholarship, ApplicationPlan, Task, Notification; include migration scripts. Product requirements: (A) Student onboarding wizard with consent; (B) College list builder with sliders/filters and explanation of “why this match” using interpretable factors; (C) Roadmap timeline view with drag-and-drop tasks and auto-updates when requirements change; (D) Essay workspace with versioning, rubric scoring (content, structure, voice, reflection, authenticity), and originality checks; (E) Application strategy simulator (what-if scenarios for deadlines/test submissions/major choices); (F) Offer comparison tool (aid letters normalization and 4-year net-cost projection). Retrieval & data: implement connectors for public sources (e.g., school websites, common public databases); build a deadlines parser with deduping, conflict resolution, and provenance; cache results with TTL; schedule re-checks before key dates. LLM tasks & evaluation: define prompts, few-shot examples, and grading rubrics; add regression tests to catch degradations; include an evaluation report with precision/recall for requirement extraction and a human-readability score for essay feedback. Security & privacy: threat model (OWASP ASVS), input validation, CSRF, SSRF, RCE safeguards, content filtering; role-based data scoping; audit logs; consent & data retention policies. Operations: blue/green deploy, backups, disaster recovery RPO/RTO; feature flags; configuration via env/secret manager. UX: modern, fast, mobile-first, keyboard navigable; internationalization; simple language for teens; “explain my plan” summaries; export to PDF/CSV. Output requirements: deliver a working MVP deployed to a cloud environment with seeded demo users, plus a clickable prototype and screenshots; include a 90-day roadmap (MVP, Beta, GA) with scope, KPIs (activation, weekly active students, task completion rate, deadline miss rate, essay quality lift), and success criteria; provide cost estimates and scaling plan to 100k MAU. Acceptance criteria: all core flows work offline in a mocked mode; at least 80% of required data fields validated; no PII in logs; test coverage ≥70% backend and ≥50% frontend; lighthouse performance ≥85 mobile; accessibility automated checks pass; every AI suggestion shows sources or a “confidence + verification” hint; user can build a college list, receive a task timeline, draft and iterate on an essay with rubric feedback, set reminders, and export an application plan. Now: propose the architecture and tech stack; generate the repo (monorepo or polyrepo), code the MVP with the above features, populate mock/public data, write docs, run tests, stand up the deployment, and return (1) repo tree, (2) setup instructions, (3) environment variables, (4) admin and student demo accounts, (5) sample transcripts/activities, (6) screenshots/links, and (7) a brief “what’s next” plan.
