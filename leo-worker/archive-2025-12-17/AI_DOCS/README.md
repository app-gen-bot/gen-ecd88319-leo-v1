# AI_DOCS

Quick reference for AI assistants working on Leonardo App Factory.

**READ THIS FOLDER FIRST** before making implementation plans.

## Contents

- **STAGES.md** - How to implement pipeline stages
- **AGENTS.md** - Agent patterns and examples
- **TECH-STACK.md** - What technologies we use and why
- **PLAN_CONTENT.md** - What goes in a plan.md file

## Philosophy

- Point to code examples, don't duplicate
- Keep it concise - one screen or less per doc
- Update when patterns change
- If you find yourself explaining the same thing twice, add it here
