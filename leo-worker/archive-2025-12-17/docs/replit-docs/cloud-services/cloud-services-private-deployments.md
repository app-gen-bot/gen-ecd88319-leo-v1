Private published apps add authentication to your Replit Apps without requiring any
code changes. When enabled, Replit restricts access to your app using a Replit login screen.
Only logged in members of your Organization that have access can use the site.

Private Deployments are available only to Teams subscribers. Your Replit App
must be in a Team workspace to use Private Deployments.

Restricted app access is useful for project types including the following:

- Internal tools
- Apps in the beta testing phase
- Apps that access sensitive information

## ​Features

Private published apps provide the following features:

- Access Management: Grant or restrict app access to any users or groups within your Replit Team
- Zero Code Configuration: Seamless authentication for your app with no code changes required

## ​Usage

When publishing your Replit App from a Teams workspace, you can choose between a Public or Private published app.
