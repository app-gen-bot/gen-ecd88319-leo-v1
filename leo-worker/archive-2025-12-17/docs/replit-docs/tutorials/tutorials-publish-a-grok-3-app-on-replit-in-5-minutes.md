Have you ever wished you could create a fun, playable game without writing a single line of code?

With Grok 3 and Replit, you can turn this wish into reality in just minutes.

## ​What you’ll build

In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

- Create a functioning brick breaker game using AI
- Publish your game online with zero coding knowledge
- Combine Grok 3 and Replit to build real applications
- Share your creation with friends through a public URL

## ​What you’ll need

Before getting started, you’ll need:

- A Replit account
- An X account logged into grok.com

That’s it! No programming experience, no special software, no complicated setups.

## ​Building your game step by step

1

Generate your game code with Grok 3

Ask Grok 3: “Help me create a brick breaker game with HTML.” Grok 3 will
quickly generate all the HTML code needed for a functioning game. Don’t
worry about understanding the code—that’s the beauty of this process!

2

Set up your Replit environment

- Log into Replit - From the homepage, create a Node app - Create a new file
called game.html - Paste the code Grok generated into this file Replit’s
Workspace makes it incredibly easy to manage
your files and see real-time updates.

3

Configure your app with Replit Assistant

- Go to Assistant in Replit - Type “serve the game in @game.html” (the @
symbol mentions the file) - Select enter Replit
Assistant will automatically
configure the app settings, install any needed dependencies, and set up a
server around your game in index.js.

4

Test your game locally

After applying all the changes, your brick breaker game will be running in
your browser. You can play it right away in the
Webview
to make sure everything works properly!

5

Publish your game to the internet

- Select the Publish button - Name your project (e.g.,
“brick-breaker-grok”) - Let Replit handle all the technical publishing
details - Wait about two minutes for publishing to complete Replit’s
Deployments
system takes care of setting up servers, configuring domains, and ensuring
your game runs smoothly online.

## ​The result: Your own publicly available game

Once published, your game is accessible to anyone through a public URL (like brickbreakergrok.replit.app). This isn’t just running on your computer—it’s a Replit App on the internet that anyone can play!

You can even monitor your published app to see how many people are playing your game and how it’s performing.

## ​Why this matters

This simple demonstration shows how dramatically technology has evolved. Just a few years ago, creating and publishing a game would have required:

- Learning multiple programming languages
- Understanding web servers and hosting
- Dealing with complex publishing processes

Today, you can do it all through conversation with AI and a few clicks. Replit is the fastest way to go from idea to app.

## ​Take your game further

Customize your gameUse Replit Assistant to help you customize your game: - Change colors,
graphics, and game elements - Adjust difficulty levels - Add sound effects
or background music Simply describe what you want to change, and Assistant
will help implement it.

Add advanced featuresTake your game to the next level with: - Score tracking and leaderboards -
Multiple game levels - Power-ups and special abilities Ask Assistant: “Help
me add a scoring system to my brick breaker game”

Share and promoteOnce your game is published: - Add a custom
domain
for a professional touch - Share the link on social media - Get feedback
from friends and family Replit makes updating your published app simple -
just make changes and republish.

## ​What will you build next?

The brick breaker game is just the beginning. Using the same approach, you could create:

- Interactive quizzes
- Simple productivity tools
- Personal websites
- And much more!
