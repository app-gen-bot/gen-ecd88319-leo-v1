### ​What is a Warning in Replit?

A staff member will send you a warning when you violate the Community Standards, Terms of Service, or Privacy Policy. Other disciplinary actions may include unpublishing of your Replit App(s), cancellation of a Bounty, and/or hiding/deleting Bounty Applications.

### ​Can I republish my Replit App after it’s been unpublished?

Yes. Revise your Replit App to abide by the Community Standards, then republish.

### ​What happens when I’m banned from the Community?

When banned from the community, you cannot create posts, share Replit App, or participate in Bounties. However, you can still use the online IDE for features unrelated to community activity.

### ​What happens when I’m banned from Replit?

A ban from Replit means you cannot log into your account and all Replit App will have been deleted. This often occurs for violating the Terms of Service.

### ​How can I appeal a ban?

Send an email to appeals@replit.com with your Replit username, a description of the action that you are appealing, and your reasons for the appeal.
