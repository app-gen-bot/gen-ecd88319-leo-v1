## ​Platform

### ​Security scanner updates

Experience faster, smarter security scanning with our major Security Scanner update. Scans now cache results and only re-run when your code changes, making subsequent scans lightning fast. New ignore functionality lets you hide security issues you don’t want to see while keeping them discoverable when needed.

### ​Agent system prompt optimization

Enjoy faster, more efficient Agent interactions with our latest system improvements. Agent now completes tasks 2-3 seconds faster per action while maintaining the same high-quality results you expect.

### ​New app creation experience

Build better apps with our redesigned creation experience! Now you can visualize and plan your app before building, helping you understand the development plan and iterate on design direction. See exactly what Agent will build before committing to the rapid build process.

### ​New App Store screenshots

Check out our fresh new look in the App Store and Google Play Store! Updated screenshots now showcase our latest features and improved iPad experience.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​New landing page for viewer seats

Organization viewers now get a dedicated dashboard to easily discover and access apps in their Replit organization. Star favorites, search deployed apps, and discover popular deployments - all automatically filtered to show only apps you have access to.

### ​Organization suspension from UBB services

Enhanced billing protection ensures sustainable service for all users by preventing abuse of unpaid services in enterprise accounts.
