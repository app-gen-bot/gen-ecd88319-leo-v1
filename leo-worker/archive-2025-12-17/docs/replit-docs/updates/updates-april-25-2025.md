## ​Platform updates

### ​Mobile app Agent tour and deployments in dock

The mobile app now features a guided Agent onboarding tour to help new users get started quickly. Plus, we’ve added Deployments to the dock by default, making it easier to manage your deployed applications right from your mobile device.

### ​Deployment secrets sync with workspace secrets

Deployments now automatically sync with your Workspace secrets! This means less error-prone redeploys as your environment variables stay in sync. You can still override individual values when needed by “unsyncing” them explicitly.

### ​Enhanced checkpoint event UI

We’ve revamped the checkpoint event interface with an improved design and more intuitive controls. Plus, staff now have access to cross-session rollbacks, allowing for more powerful version management.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​Team invitation improvements

Managing team invitations is now easier with clear visibility into expired invites and the ability to re-send invitations. Whether an invite expired or is still pending, you can quickly re-send it with a single click.

### ​Advanced privacy settings for teams

Enterprise teams now have enhanced control over their organization’s data with new Advanced Privacy settings. Prevent members from creating public apps or exporting code as zip files, ensuring your intellectual property stays protected within your organization.
