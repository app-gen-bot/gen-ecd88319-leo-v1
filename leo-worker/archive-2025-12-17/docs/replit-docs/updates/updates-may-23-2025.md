## ​Platform updates

### ​Sonnet 4 in Agent

Replit Agent is now powered by Claude Sonnet 4.0.

We’re excited to see what you’ll build with the latest & greatest from Anthropic.

### ​Faster Agent responses

We’ve made improvements to Agent stability and performance, resulting in a smoother, more reliable coding experience.

Experience a sharp reduction in response times for most queries—making Agent feel more responsive and natural.

### ​Visual Editor rollout

We’ve rolled out a new, updated Visual Editor. Create beautiful layouts visually while the editor automatically generates the corresponding code, making web development more accessible and efficient. Check it out here to learn more.

### ​Extended app preview time

Your app previews now stay active for 10 minutes after closing your workspace (up from just 20 seconds). This provides a much smoother experience when multitasking or sharing your work, especially on mobile devices where you might switch between apps while testing your project.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​Team member app transfers

Organization members can now transfer their apps to other members of their org. This powerful feature solves key collaboration challenges, letting teams redistribute ownership of apps as projects evolve and team responsibilities change.

### ​Private Development URLs

Enterprise customers can now require private development URLs for all projects, enhancing security by ensuring development work remains protected within the organization’s environment.
