Happy Holidays!

## ​Platform updates

### ​Integrations

Integrations are now front and center in the Agent UI. You can easily add your favorite services to your Agent apps. We’ve also launched and polished quite a few new integrations, so you should check them out. Some of our favorites:

- Perplexity
- Firebase
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Google Services

### ​Build notifications

Agent now sends you notifications when it’s done working—listen for the audio notification.

If you’re a more visual person, check out the favicon of the browser tab for status updates.

### ​Database polish

The PostgreSQL pane has been renamed to “Database.” The Database pane has been renamed to “Replit Key-Value Store.” This should simplify accessing all your favorite databases.

We’ve also added a new database notification to the dock when Agent adds a database to your project.

### ​Agent improvements

Agent now pauses immediately when requested, rather than completing its current execution. This should make it easier to stop Agent when you’ve changed your mind.

You might also notice some fancy new “Run” buttons in the Agent UI. Let us know what you think!

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​Replit Teams updates

We’ve shipped a few exciting updates for Teams users:

- Teams may now customize Replit App icons and cover images
- Solid color covers have been replaced with custom images
- Replit Teams is now available on Mobile!

Now you can create shareholder value from practically anywhere 🤯
