- Assistant + Workflows
- Better Zips
- Autoscale deployment optimizations

## ​Platform updates

### ​Assistant + Workflows

Assistant now integrates with “Workflows.” That means you can chat with Assistant to configure how your Replit Apps run.

If you haven’t used Workflows before, they’re really cool and can take your Replit Apps to the next level.

You can learn more here.

### ​Better Zips

We’ve improved the speed and reliability of zipping Replit Apps. You’ll notice “export as zip” is now lightning fast.

### ​Autoscale deployment optimizations

Autoscale deployments are now more reliable and faster thanks to some behind-the-scenes improvements on cold-start times.
