### ​Replit Auth

Replit Auth is out for all users! It’s a built-in authentication system that lets you add user login to your apps with minimal setup. Instead of building complex authentication systems from scratch, Replit Auth provides a secure, ready-to-use solution integrated with Replit’s infrastructure.

Key Features:

- Zero setup - Add authentication with a single prompt in Agent
- Built-in security - Uses Replit’s infrastructure with protections against common attacks
- User management - Simplified user administration through the Auth pane
- Database integration - Automatic user entries in your database
- Customizable login page - Personalize the login experience for your app
- Password reset - Replit handles password reset emails, eliminating the need for your own email delivery provider

Getting started is simple - just include a request for Replit Auth in your Agent prompt:

### ​Updated UBB suspension policy

We’ve improved our payment grace period system to better support established users while protecting their deployments. Longer-standing users now have more time to address payment issues, ensuring that critical applications stay online while payment details are updated.

### ​App type selector fully launched

The app type selector is now available to all users! This feature makes it easier to choose the right template when starting a new project, helping you get up and running faster with appropriate configurations for your specific use case.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​New unified org switcher

We’ve streamlined the organization switching experience with a new unified interface. This cleaner, more intuitive design makes it easier to navigate between your personal account and various organizations, helping you collaborate more efficiently.

### ​Replit Teams Annual plan

Replit Teams now offers an annual plan option, providing a more cost-effective way for teams to access our collaborative features. Subscribe annually to unlock additional value for your team’s development needs.
