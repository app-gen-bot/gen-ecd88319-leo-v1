### ​SOC 2 Type II certification

Replit is now SOC 2 Type II certified, having completed a rigorous 12-month security audit with zero exceptions or comments. This certification validates our enterprise-grade security practices and demonstrates our platform’s reliability and compliance for enterprise customers.

### ​Multiple SSO providers for Enterprise

Enterprise customers can now configure multiple SSO providers and set up multiple organizations per provider. This gives large companies the flexibility to use different authentication providers for different teams while maintaining centralized control and shared access where needed.
