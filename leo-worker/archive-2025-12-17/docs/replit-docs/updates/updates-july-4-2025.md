## ​Platform

### ​Dynamic Intelligence

Get first-try correct results on complex builds with Dynamic Intelligence. This powerful collection of advanced features includes Extended Thinking for deeper analysis and High Power mode that upgrades Agent to Claude Opus—perfect for when precision matters most.

### ​Web Search for Agent

Agent can now search the web and fetch up-to-date information with Web Search. Build apps with the latest documentation, current market data, and accurate details from across the internet. No more knowledge cutoffs—your apps now use the most recent information available.

### ​Custom Agent Instructions

Personalize your Agent experience with replit.md. This special file lets you define your coding style, project preferences, and context. Agent automatically creates this file using proven best practices, and you can customize it to match your workflow.

### ​Effort-based billing

Experience smarter checkpoint pricing with our new effort-based billing. Dynamic pricing based on actual agent effort creates single checkpoints per run instead of multiple ones. Free users now get $3 worth of checkpoints instead of just 5 fixed ones.

### ​Improved icons

Enjoy faster, more beautiful App icons. We’ve upgraded to a curated selection of pre-generated icons with smart semantic matching and colorful designs that load instantly.

### ​Gallery

Discover amazing community projects in our new Gallery. Browse featured projects and see what incredible things the Replit community is building.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​Teams App Store experience

Discover and manage your team’s apps like never before. The new org “App Store” experience on the Deployments page lets you star favorites, search across all deployments, see recently opened apps, and discover popular deployments based on traffic volume.
