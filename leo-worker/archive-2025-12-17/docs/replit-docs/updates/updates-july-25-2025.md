## ​What’s new

- Queue
- Domain management improvements
- Improved proof of work UI
- Admin controls for Agent High Power Models

## ​Platform

### ​Queue

Agent messages are now automatically queued, so each new request waits until the current task is complete before running. This works like a task list, letting you interact with AI in a more asynchronous, organized way.

### ​Domains improvements

You can now seamlessly move purchased domains between different Apps without redeploying. This flexible domain management approach saves time and makes it easier to reorganize your projects as they evolve.

Domains now also supports custom DNS records, giving you complete control over your domain configuration. Connect to third-party services, set up email, or configure advanced routing without leaving Replit.

### ​Improved proof of work UI

We’ve refreshed our proof of work interface with an intuitive design and helpful tooltips. This update makes it easier to understand how proof of work affects your experience and provides clearer guidance on what’s happening behind the scenes.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​Admin controls for Agent High Power Models

Organization administrators can now manage access to Agent High Power Models across their entire organization with a simple toggle. This provides greater control over AI capabilities and associated costs, ensuring your team has the right tools for their specific needs.
