## ​Platform updates

### ​New prompt examples

Discover fresh inspiration with our updated prompt examples!

We’ve standardized the language and added diverse design directions to help you create apps that go beyond the typical look and feel.

### ​View live app button

Access your deployed apps instantly! We now show a “View live app” button on the cover page whenever your app is deployed and you have permission to view it, making it easier to preview your work.

### ​Deployment prevention

Stay secure with our new deployment protection. We now prevent you from accidentally deploying development servers to production, helping you avoid security vulnerabilities before they become a problem.

### ​Security scanner improvements

Enhanced security monitoring now automatically detects and flags attempts to deploy development servers, specifically protecting against the Vite vulnerability (CVE-2025-30208) before deployment.

### ​Python run performance improvements

Python runs are now faster than ever! Thanks to internal improvements, we’ve sped up the execution time of Python runs for a smoother experience.
