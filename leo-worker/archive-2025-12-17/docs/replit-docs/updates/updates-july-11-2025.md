### ​replit.md documentation

Customize Agent’s behavior with replit.md, a special configuration file that helps Agent understand your project’s preferences, coding style, and architecture. Agent automatically creates this file using proven best practices, then uses it to build applications that match your exact specifications. Guide Agent with project context, define coding standards, specify your preferred tech stack, and set communication preferences—all in one place.

### ​Deployment privacy indicators

Quickly identify whether your deployments are public or private with new visual indicators in the deployments pane. This improvement helps prevent confusion and ensures you know exactly who can access your deployed applications.

### ​Agent multi-tool calling upgrade

Save 15% on Agent costs and get results 30% faster with our enhanced multi-tool calling system. Agent now batches operations more efficiently and handles tool errors more intelligently, delivering the same quality results while using fewer resources.
