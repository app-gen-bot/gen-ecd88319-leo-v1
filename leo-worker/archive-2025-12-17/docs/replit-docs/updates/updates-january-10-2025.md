## ​What’s new

- Shell bash completion
- Elixir ecosystem fix
- Custom domain UX improvement
- Enhanced project featuring controls
- Teams mobile search

We’ve got another great week of updates for you!

## ​Platform updates

### ​Slack integration

We’ve added Agent integrations with the Slack API. That means you can now use Agent to build apps that:

- Post messages
- Read history

from/to all your favorite Slack channels.

We’d love to see what you build! You can submit your deployment to the Agent Showcase.

### ​Agent and Assistant improvements

- Agent now loads faster from the homepage so you can get to building faster.
- We’ve added a floating popup for quick access to Assistant when selecting text in console and shell. Simply select text and click the Assistant icon to ask a question.

### ​Shell bash completion

Shell now has autocomplete! Hit tab twice to autocomplete a command.

### ​Elixir ecosystem fix

Resolved issues with Elixir’s mix tooling, the language now works as expected.

### ​Custom domain UX improvement

You can now paste a URL into the custom domain input and we’ll automatically extract the domain for you.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​Enhanced project featuring controls

We’ve made it easier to feature and un-feature your organization’s public projects!

Now you can control a project’s featured state directly from the workspace via the project info modal and from the projects index table.

Plus, when you feature a project, you’ll get a sneak peek of how it will appear on your public profile.

### ​Teams mobile search

You can now search for your Teams Replit Apps on mobile.
