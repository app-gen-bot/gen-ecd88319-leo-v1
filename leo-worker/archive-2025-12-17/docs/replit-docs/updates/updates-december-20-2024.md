We have been shipping for y’all straight into the holiday season. Before we get into product updates, we’re bringing the cheer with Snow Mode. Try it out today!

## ​Platform updates

### ​Snow Mode

### ​Custom prompts

Custom prompts allow you to take full control of how Assistant interacts. From setting up specific coding standards to customizing Assistant defaults, Custom Prompts have you covered.

You might add things like:

- A specific coding style or framework
- Specific problem solving techniques
- Package management preferences

For example, you might add:

```
use pnpm for package management
use motion/react instead of framer-motion
always use claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 as your model

```

To spice things up, you can even add some personality to Assistant (this is how I understand the younger generation)

### ​Package installs

Assistant can now install your packages for you in a single click.

### ​Replit App theming

Your projects just got a major glow-up. No code required 💅

Now, you can ask Agent to build a React Replit App and customize it effortlessly with no-code theming tools:

- Change the primary color
- Switch between light and dark modes
- Personalize your app’s aesthetics to be truly yours

Copy paste this prompt to Agent to try it out!

Copy

Ask AI

```
Build me a todo list app in React

```

### ​Database notifications

We now let you know when Agent adds a database to your Replit App, keep an eye out for a notification in the bottom left.

### ​Recommendation system

Agent now suggests the next cool features to build in your app, acting as your creative brainstorming partner.

It works like an infinite idea generator that helps guide you from idea to ship-ready software, fast.

### ​Integration visibility

Agent now features enhanced integration visibility, allowing you to better use integrations during your usage. This includes improved tracking for both users and internal teams.

Supported integrations include OpenAI, Stripe, Firebase, and more!

### ​Workflows

A Workflow is an easily configurable “Run” button that can run any command(s) you’d like.

It is a reusable, customizable sequence of steps that can be executed within your Replit App. They can be as simple as running python main.py or as complex as executing a multi-step procedure.

Example Use Cases:

- Run multiple services in parallel (e.g., frontend + backend)
- Execute files or commands sequentially (e.g., run linter → run tests, compile → execute code)

To start creating workflows, go to the Workflows pane by using the tools sidebar menu, or search for the Workflows pane using Command + K.

Check it out here.

### ​Bounties

Even AI-first developments can benefit from a human touch for that final input and polish.

Check out Bounties Services to connect with vetted developers who help ship your idea today.
