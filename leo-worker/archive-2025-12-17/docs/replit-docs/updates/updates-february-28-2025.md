## ​Platform updates

### ​Agent v2

We’ve launched a new Agent experience that is now available to all users. This new Agent is faster, more accurate, and more capable than the previous version.

It’s now powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic’s most advanced model yet.

You can try it out by joining the Explorer Program. Find instructions here.

### ​Deployment improvements

We’ve added AI suggestions for users selecting static deployment for dynamic apps, improving Agent behavior when handling deployment requests.

### ​Claude 3.7 Sonnet release

We’ve upgraded Advanced Assistant mode with Claude 3.7 Sonnet for all paid users. This means improved accuracy and capability for complex requests.

### ​Database performance improvement

Database operations are now faster than ever, with the most expensive operation reduced from 200ms to under 1ms.

### ​Better documentation

We’ve redesigned our documentation to be easier to understand and use, making it completely LLM-friendly.

The documentation now features a “Copy Page” button, which allows you to copy the entire page as markdown. You can also index our documentation with llms.txt and llms-full.txt to use with your own LLMs.
