## ​What’s new

- Notion integration
- PayPal checkout integration
- Improved image handling for broken Unsplash URLs
- Enhanced enterprise deployment privacy settings

## ​Platform updates

### ​Notion integration

The Notion Agent integration is now available to all users, allowing seamless integration between your Replit projects and Notion workspaces.

Quickly build applications that leverage Notion’s powerful database and document capabilities with guided setup through Agent. This integration enables connection with Notion API for building connected applications.

That means you can build Replit apps that push and pull data from your Notion workspaces!

### ​PayPal checkout integration

Enable PayPal payments in your applications with our new PayPal checkout integration.

Now available to all users, this integration makes it easy to add a trusted payment option to your applications, expanding your ability to monetize your projects.

### ​Improved image handling for broken Unsplash URLs

Say goodbye to broken stock images in your projects!

If you didn’t know, Agent already adds stock images to your projects from Unsplash. But sometimes URLs break. The reason? LLMs are great at hallucinating stock image URLs.

We’ve added a feature that automatically replaces broken stock images with working alternatives, ensuring your applications always display professionally.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​Enhanced enterprise deployment privacy settings

Enterprise customers now have greater control over Deployment privacy with multiple configuration options.

This enhanced feature allows organizations to precisely manage access to their deployed applications, providing the security and flexibility that enterprise environments demand. Team users now also benefit from private Deployments by default, requiring explicit opt-in for public sharing.
