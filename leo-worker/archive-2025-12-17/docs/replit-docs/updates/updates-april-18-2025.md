## ​Platform updates

### ​Smarter integrations matching

Agent now better identifies when to add external tools and services in new chats. Try creating a new chat and prompting:

Copy

Ask AI

```
Add AI with Anthropic to my app
```

You’ll experience more accurate results as Agent connects your apps with external services, helping you build more powerful applications faster.

### ​Faster AI responses

We’ve supercharged our AI systems to deliver dramatically faster responses:

- Experience near-instant interactions with both Agent and Assistant
- Enjoy smoother conversations with faster response times
- Building and iterating on your apps is now more fluid than ever

### ​Streamlined Agent progress UX

The new “Preview” pane replaces both the “Progress” and “Webview” panes, positioning it front and center to eliminate the output drawer. This improvement helps you stay in flow while building apps without having to dig into code. We’ve also added helpful tips through a floating banner to guide you during builds.

### ​Clearer checkpoint titles

Checkpoints are now more accessible with concise titles, while preserving detailed technical information in commit descriptions. This makes your project history easier to understand without sacrificing the technical details you need.

### ​Dev preview URL education

We’ve added an educational banner when a Dev Preview is opened in a new tab, helping you understand the purpose of .replit.dev URLs as you build and test your applications.

### ​Better file uploads

We’ve made file uploads more reliable and easier to use, with a larger “drag and drop” area.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​Bulk organization invites

Teams can now invite multiple users to their Organization at once, streamlining collaboration and onboarding for larger groups.

### ​Enhanced app restoration

Organization admins can now view recently deleted Apps with a new CLUI command, making the existing restore-repl command significantly more usable. This helps you recover important projects quickly when needed.
