- Assistant inline shell commands

## ​Platform updates

### ​SendGrid integration

You can now build email integrations with Agent. This allows you to send emails from your new Agent projects using the SendGrid API.

### ​Web view mobile support

We’ve added the ability to scale web view to common mobile screen sizes. In addition, we’ve added a QR code in the URL dropdown and networking pane for easier mobile device testing.

As a reminder—even while you’re building your project, it’s accessible from the internet. Just visit the dev URL from any device.

### ​DNS record format update

We’ve modified how custom domain DNS records are formatted to match industry standards.

This should make it easier to configure custom domains.

### ​Flask deployment upgrade

gunicorn is now the default web server for Flask stack deployments.

This resulted in a 40x performance improvement over previous Flask deployments.

### ​Assistant inline shell commands

Assistant can now execute shell commands directly in the chat pane. Save time by running commands without leaving the chat!

We’ve also added warnings for potentially dangerous shell commands and revamped the UI for installing packages.
