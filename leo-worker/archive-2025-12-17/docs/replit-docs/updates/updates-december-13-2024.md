## ​What’s new

- Assistant Features
- Rollback with Ease
- Build Beautiful Apps
- Rapid Scraping / Screenshots
- Usage Updates You’ll Love

This week, we launched Assistant, a new AI tool that allows you to edit multiple files and apply changes directly.

Assistant is optimized for chat and quick edits. Often, we find ourselves creating an MVP with Agent, then performing quick edits with Assistant.

Here are some of our favorite parts of Assistant:

- Lightweight: Assistant is optimized for chat and quick edits, now with the ability to edit multiple files and apply changes directly.
- Mentions and screenshots: Mention files or URLs in your prompts. We can scrape the URL or take a screenshot for you.
- Rollbacks: Assistant automatically creates checkpoints, allowing you to easily preview edits as diff and roll back with a single click.
- Flexibility: Assistant works in any Replit App, regardless of the tech stack. Bring your existing projects or start fresh with Agent.
- More Beautiful Apps: Improved support for responsive React apps allows you to create stunning apps.
- Billings Updates: We’ve removed all usage limits for Agents. We’ve also increased the credits included in your subscription.

## ​Platform updates

### ​Assistant Features

Replit Assistant is a lightweight AI tool built for chat and quick edits. It can edit multiple files and apply them directly on it’s own.

We find Assistant excels when you give it context—that might mean specific features, files (mention them with @file), or URLs (just paste them in).

Assistant can help you iterate faster and uses about 5x less credits than Agent.

### ​Rollback with Ease

Assistant automatically creates checkpoints, allowing you to easily preview edits as diffs and roll back with a single click if anything looks off.

### ​Build Beautiful Apps

We’ve improved support for React apps, ensuring your apps appear and function at their best.

### ​Rapid Scraping / Screenshots

Screenshot or scrape the contents of any site directly into your prompts with Assistant or Agent.

Simply paste a URL and we’ll offer to take a screenshot or scrape the contents of the page.

As always, you can always attach images to your prompts or mention files with @file.

### ​Usage Updates You’ll Love

- No More Usage Quotas: Say goodbye to limits for Agent usage.
- More Credits for Subscribers: Core subscribers now receive increased credits.

We’re also introducing billing tools to allow you to monitor and limit your spend. Head over to the “usage” tab in Replit to see your usage and set limits.
