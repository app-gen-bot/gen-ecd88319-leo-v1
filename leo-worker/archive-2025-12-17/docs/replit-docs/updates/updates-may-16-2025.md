### ​Checkpoint previews

Introducing checkpoint previews to Replit’s development environment. Visualize your app at different stages of development without rebuilding or restoring previous versions.

This capability enables easier progress tracking, iteration comparison, and versioning—offering a comprehensive view of your project’s evolution. This feature pairs with the vibe coding workflow.

### ​Replit time travel

The time travel feature has landed on Replit. Navigate seamlessly through your project history while maintaining your development context.

Explore various versions, understand evolutionary changes, recover from missteps, and experiment with greater confidence—all within your current development environment. This complements the Git integration for more powerful version control.

### ​Ask Agent to add a database

Database configuration becomes straightforward with Agent integration in the DB pane. This AI-powered workflow guides you through database setup, simplifying data persistence implementation without complex configuration code.

Developers can focus on building core functionality while Agent handles the database details. Learn more about Replit Agent and database options.

### ​Replit Auth matching by default

User authentication in your apps becomes effortless with automatic Replit Auth matching.

This feature activates when your application requires authentication. It eliminates the need for custom registration forms, password recovery systems, or social login configurations. This creates a smoother path to secure user management.

### ​Full-screen email verification

A streamlined verification process for protected actions enhances account security.

This integrated approach presents email verification after sign-in when needed. It ensures account protection while maintaining a consistent user experience—balancing security with convenience.

This is part of the ongoing commitment to information security.

### ​Google Analytics blueprint

Monitor your application’s performance with the Google Analytics blueprint.

Agent now integrates analytics setup directly into your development workflow. This enables traffic monitoring, user behavior tracking, and growth metrics without complex configuration.

It brings professional analytics capabilities to every developer. Try it with Agent integrations.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​SCIM for Enterprise customers

The new SCIM integration empowers Enterprise customers to manage Replit access directly through their identity providers.

Connect Okta, Active Directory, Rippling, or other identity platforms to automate Replit seat provisioning and deprovisioning. This eliminates manual user management overhead and streamlines enterprise workflows.

Read the detailed SCIM documentation to get started.

### ​Viewer seats for Replit Teams

Introducing Viewer Seats for Replit Teams. Share your applications with stakeholders who only view and interact with your apps—not edit them—without requiring full team licenses.

Perfect for sharing with executives, clients, or teammates who use but don’t build your tools. Learn how to set up and manage Viewer Seats.
