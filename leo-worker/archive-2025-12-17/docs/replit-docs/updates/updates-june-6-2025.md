## ​Platform updates

### ​Visual Editor image management

Image management in Visual Editor is now effortless. Select any image and instantly update it by swapping URLs or uploading new files directly. You’ll see immediate previews and seamless updates, making it faster than ever to create visually engaging content. The refreshed interface also delivers improved responsiveness for a smoother editing experience.

### ​New Agent entrypoints in workspace

We’ve introduced contextual Agent entrypoints throughout your workspace to accelerate debugging and problem-solving. Agent now appears exactly where you need help most, eliminating the friction of context switching between tools.

Get instant assistance with code debugging, console errors, and deployment issues directly in context. Whether you’re troubleshooting a runtime error or need help understanding a complex function, Agent provides targeted support without disrupting your workflow.

The integrated chat history ensures continuity across debugging sessions, so you can build on previous conversations and maintain context as you work through complex problems.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​CSV export for Teams admins

Organization administrators can now export the complete apps table as a CSV file. This streamlines tracking, analysis, and reporting on your organization’s repl usage, with full metadata including app visibility status and key usage metrics.

### ​Teams viewer seat management

Teams now offer more flexible seat management with streamlined upgrade workflows. Viewers can request member seat upgrades, while administrators can review and approve these requests directly from the members page. The enhanced interface for editing member roles makes team management more intuitive and efficient.
