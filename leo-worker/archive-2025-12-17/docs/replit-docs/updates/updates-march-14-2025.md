## ​Platform updates

### ​Neon DB history retention

We’ve added configurable history retention for Neon databases to help you manage costs more effectively. This directly addresses your feedback about database cost management.

### ​Enhanced link context features

You can now see live previews of link content (screenshots and text) in both Assistant and Agent. We’ve also extended this feature to our Mobile App.

### ​Assistant model selection

For our Advanced users, we’ve added the option to switch back to Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 in Assistant settings. We’re continuously working on performance improvements for Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

### ​Web View performance improvements

Enjoy smoother iframe navigation and better compatibility with secure websites in Web View. We’ve enhanced our proxy system to handle security headers more intelligently, eliminating those frustrating navigation blocks you may have encountered previously.
