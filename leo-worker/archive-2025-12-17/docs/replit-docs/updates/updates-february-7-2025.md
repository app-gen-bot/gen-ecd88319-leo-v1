### ​Agent is now free to try

Your first 10 checkpoints are on us (that includes existing, paid developers too). Select https://replit.com to give them a shot.

### ​Replit Mobile

We’ve completely rebuilt Replit Mobile from the ground up! Our new mobile app delivers a faster, more intuitive coding experience on the go.

Select https://replit.com/mobile to try it.

### ​New Replit App cover pages

Your cover pages got a major upgrade. They’re now more developer-friendly and feature the starting prompt for any app built with Agent.

### ​Documentation migration

We’ve upgraded our documentation platform to Mintlify, making it easier than ever to navigate and access information.

A huge thank you to the Mintlify team for their help in migrating our documentation.

### ​Improved database viewer

Our database viewer now uses Drizzle Studio, providing a more robust and developer-friendly experience for interacting with your data.

Try it out and let us know what you think!

### ​Agent actions

Your Agent input box just got smarter with new integrated actions for additional changes. This is just the beginning—we’re working on more seamless integrations to make your development experience even smoother.
