## ​Platform updates

### ​Figma import

Turn your designs into code with the new Figma imports feature! Now available to all users at Replit.com/import, this powerful integration lets you seamlessly convert Figma designs into working code. This dramatically speeds up your development workflow and bridges the gap between design and implementation.

### ​Mobile app update

The latest mobile app update is now available in the App and Play stores! The update includes a refreshed home screen design and new in-app UBB limit setting controls. This gives you more flexibility and control over your mobile development experience.

### ​Workspace quality improvements

The team has rolled out numerous improvements to make your creation experience smoother and more intuitive. From a more reliable preview pane to more consistent mobile behavior, these refinements create a more polished environment for bringing your ideas to life.

### ​Infrastructure improvements

Behind the scenes, the team is modernizing infrastructure to deliver a faster, more stable platform. These technical improvements pave the way for more powerful features and a better developer experience in the future.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​Organization app sharing improvement

Enjoy a cleaner, more organized workspace in your teams! New apps created in organizations will no longer automatically share with all members. This reduces clutter and gives you more control over what appears in team members’ workspaces.

### ​Teams members page improvements

Managing your team just got easier with new usability improvements to the Teams Members page. Now you can sort, filter, and search across Members, Viewers, and Invites tabs. These are features that enterprise customers have been requesting to help manage large teams efficiently.
