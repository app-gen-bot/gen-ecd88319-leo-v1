🎆 Happy New Year!

We’ve taken some time to recharge, but we’re still shipping updates.

## ​Platform updates

### ​xAI integration

Agent can now add xAI directly to your apps.

Add Grok to your projects and deploy them in seconds. Just mention “add AI features with xAI” in your prompts or select xAI from integrations—we’ll build with the API.

We’re hard at work bringing your favorite integrations to Agent & Assistant.

### ​Custom domain error handling

We added specific error messages for custom domain verification failures, this should help you debug issues faster.

### ​Menu search feature

You can now search the menu items in the sidebar in your Replit Apps.

### ​Neon database improvements

We’ve optimized our Neon database integration! Databases added with Agent are now more cost friendly and performant.

### ​React by default

We’ve updated the default template for new frontend Replit Apps to use React. Your projects will now be more beautiful and functional out of the box.

## ​Teams and Enterprise

### ​Replit Teams login

We’ve updated the Teams login flow to make it easier to get started. This includes a new login experience with team context selection page and improved account switching for Teams customers.
