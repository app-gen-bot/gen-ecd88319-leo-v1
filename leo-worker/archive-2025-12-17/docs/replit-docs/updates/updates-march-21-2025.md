## ​Platform updates

### ​Visual Editor

Agent just got eyes - click. describe. done.

We’ve just launched an exciting new feature—you can now click and select elements directly in your projects for JavaScript apps!

This makes building and editing your UI more intuitive than ever. Want to learn more? Check out our detailed walkthrough on the blog at https://blog.replit.com/cartographer.

### ​Agent timeline messages

You’ll now see a visual indicator whenever Agent sets up a Blueprint for your project. This makes it easier to follow along with what Agent is doing and understand the development process.

We’ve also enhanced our analytics to better track how you’re using Blueprints, helping us make smarter improvements in the future.
