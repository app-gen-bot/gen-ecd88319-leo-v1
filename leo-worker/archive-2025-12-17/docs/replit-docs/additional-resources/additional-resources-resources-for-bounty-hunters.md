## ​Replit Profile Tips

Use this template to create a portfolio of work to pin to your profile.

Add links to previous work, Github profile, Discord, etc. in your profile that are relevant and up to date.

Make sure the Replit Apps on your profile are a good representation of your skills.

Don’t include partial pieces of work on your profile page (hide those in a folder or use Private Replit Apps).

The Replit-generated names like PuzzlingPriceyKey are cool and all, but make sure the Replit Apps on your profile have sensible names and are published with nice cover photos.
