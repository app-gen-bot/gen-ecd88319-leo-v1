# ​Developing your Extension

In every extension Replit App, you will see a button labeled Extension Devtools in the top-right corner of the workspace.

If you do not see this button, make sure your Replit App is configured to be an Extension.

The Extension Devtools pane makes it easy to edit your Extension’s metadata and manage Tools and File Handlers.

### ​Extension Metadata

Click the Edit button in the top-right corner of your Extension preview to edit it. See docs on the manifest file.

Click the ”+” Icon next to File Handlers or click New File Handler. You will then be prompted to fill out the necessary information for the file handler. See Type Definition.

To preview a file handler in action, click the Open button on the right side of an existing file handler.

### ​Tools

Click the ”+” Icon next to Tools or click New Tool. You will then be prompted to fill out the necessary information for the new tool. See Type Definition.
