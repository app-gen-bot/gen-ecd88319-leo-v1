Multiplayer transforms your Replit workspace into a collaborative environment where up to
four users can create and update apps together in real time.

This shared experience provides collaborators the same workspace tools and environment to
create a seamless team development experience.

## ​Features

Multiplayer includes the following features:

- Real-time collaboration: Work on the same Replit App and instantly view changes and workspace runs
- Shared workspace: Experience full workspace sharing including Shell and Console output in real time
- Observation mode: See collaborators’ code changes and file navigation as they happen
