Preview shows your web app output and offers browser developer tools and debugging
capabilities.

When you launch your web app using the Run button, Replit assigns it a temporary URL
that’s reachable on the internet. The Preview tool renders the page just as you would
see in a browser. It also includes developer tools with functionality similar to
what you find in popular browsers.

Preview is the new name for Webview.

## ​Features
