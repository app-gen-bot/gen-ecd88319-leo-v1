Keyboard shortcuts let you run commands, modify text, and navigate the workspace
using configurable key combinations. You can set and use keyboard shortcuts in
the Replit.com web app and desktop app.

## ​Viewing keyboard shortcuts

The Replit.com web app and desktop apps keep separate shortcut preferences. Changes in one environment don’t affect the other.

To view your keyboard shortcut settings, follow these steps:

1. Open a Replit App to navigate to the workspace.
1. Open the  User Settings tab from
 All tools in the dock.
Alternatively, search for “User Settings” using the
 magnifying glass.
1. Select the Keyboard shortcuts tab to view the list of commands and their assigned shortcuts.

## ​Customizing keyboard shortcuts

To add or modify a keyboard shortcut, follow these steps:

1. Select Add shortcut, located next
to the unassigned command, or the  pencil icon for assigned commands.
1. When “Recording…” appears next to the command, press the key combination you want to assign.
To cancel recording, click an empty area inside the tab.
1. To revert the shortcut, select the  rollback icon.

## ​Removing keyboard shortcuts

To remove a keyboard shortcut, select the  trash icon next to the command.

## ​Tab navigation

You can use the browser Tab key navigation to navigate between the interactive elements
on a page. However, the File Editor, Console, and Shell tools capture the Tab key as
input for purposes including indentation.

To continue  cycling through page elements while in these tools, follow these steps:

1. Press Esc to release focus from the tools
1. Press Tab to move to the next element
