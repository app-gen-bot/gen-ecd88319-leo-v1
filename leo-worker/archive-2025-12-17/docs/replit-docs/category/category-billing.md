Replit’s billing system is designed to keep things simple and predictable. When you subscribe to a Replit plan, you receive monthly credits that are included in your subscription fee.

## Core Plan

in monthly credits to cover your development needs

## Teams Plan

per user per month for collaborative development

This means your usage up to your monthly credit allowance is covered by your subscription—no additional charges. Only when you exceed your monthly credits will you be charged for additional usage.

These credits cover all your usage across Replit’s platform, including AI features like Agent and Assistant, publishing, database operations, and more. Your subscription credits reset each month, giving you a fresh allowance to build and publish your projects.

Beyond the credit system, Replit provides comprehensive billing tools to help you monitor your spending patterns, set monthly budget limits, and receive alerts when you reach spending thresholds. You can configure alerts and budget limits to prevent unexpected charges and give yourself time to increase your budget if needed for uninterrupted access to your projects.
