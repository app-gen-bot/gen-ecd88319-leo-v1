## ​What is a Replit App?

Replit Apps are cloud-hosted projects that contain code, data, and assets.
You can create, run, and publish them from a secure, isolated environment.

Replit Apps integrate with the following tools in your Replit workspace to provide
a seamless development experience:

- AI-powered tools: Use Agent and Assistant to create, debug, and explain your code.
- Collaboration: Work with others in real time on the same app.
- Publishing: Publish your app to the cloud with a single click.
- Templates: Start your app quickly using preset configurations for various use cases.

Replit App is the new product name for Repl. To learn more about the
renaming, see

.

## ​Key features

Replit Apps offer the following features:

- Zero-setup: Create apps or write code directly on Replit.com without any installs or configuration.
- Auto-save: Your project continuously saves changes to the cloud and lets you resume coding from any web browser
- Version Control: Track changes, explore file history, and sync your files without any configuration, through Replit’s version control systems
- Public/Private Visibility Controls: Control who can view, run, or create a Remix of your app with privacy settings
- Publishing: Publish your code to the cloud without making any complex configuration changes
- Custom App URLs: Get a unique URL for your app or assign a custom domain for a professional presence

Files uploaded to your Workspace are only available during development and
aren’t accessible to your published app or other builders. Use Object
Storage to handle
builder uploads and serve files and Replit
Database to store and
retrieve data for your app and users.

To learn more about Workspace tools that streamline Replit App creation, see Workspace Overview.

## ​How it works

When you create a Replit App, Replit sets up a private space for your project in the cloud.
As you add features and modifications to your app, Replit saves your changes
automatically so you can resume editing from any web browser.

Replit provides pre-configured environments with all the necessary components.
This lets you start creating your app immediately without worrying about
server configuration, database setup, or environment management.

Replit automatically assigns each Replit App a unique web address where you
can preview your app while you’re working on it. When you’re ready to share your
creation, you can publish it with just a few clicks to make it available 24/7.

## ​Storage Overview

Replit offers four primary types of storage to meet your application’s data needs. Each storage type serves different use cases and has specific limits based on your plan.

Storage limits include all data stored by your app, including installed
packages and dependencies.
