Build applications with current, real-world data using Agent’s Web Search  capabilities.

This feature overcomes knowledge cutoffs by accessing the latest information on the web. When you ask Agent to create something requiring up-to-date information, it searches the web and fetches detailed content to make your app more accurate and useful.

Web Search is valuable for finding the latest packages, tools, and information. This ensures your apps use current best practices and are more accurate.

## ​Features

Build applications with current information using Agent’s Web Search. This eliminates manual research and data gathering. Whether you’re creating a dashboard with financial data or building a website showcasing recent startup launches, Web Search ensures your app reflects reality.

Agent can perform the following Web Search actions:

- Search: Find current information, latest documentation, and real-time data from the internet
- Content fetching: Retrieve detailed information from specific websites and URLs
- Source citations: View exactly where Agent found information so you can verify and reference sources

## ​Usage

Web Search is enabled by default. Include keywords like “search,” “research,” or “use Web Search” in your prompt to trigger it.

To manually enable Web Search:

1. Open Agent in your Replit App
1. Locate the toggle controls in the chat toolbar
1. Toggle  Web Search on
