Integrations are keywords that trigger Agent to add frameworks or APIs to generated code. Agent comes with powerful built-in integrations that help you quickly build full-featured apps. These integrations activate automatically when your prompt includes keywords related to their functionality.

## ​Getting started with integrations

To use an integration in your Agent prompt, simply mention the service or functionality you need. For example:

Copy

Ask AI

```
Create a web app that uses Stripe to accept payments and Sendgrid to send confirmation emails
```

Agent will automatically detect these keywords and implement the necessary code to integrate these services into your application. The keywords are the title of the integration for all integrations on this list.
