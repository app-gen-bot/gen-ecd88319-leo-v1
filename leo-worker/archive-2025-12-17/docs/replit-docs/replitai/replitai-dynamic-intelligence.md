Dynamic Intelligence is a collection of advanced features that enhance Agent’s reasoning capabilities. It includes Extended Thinking  for deeper analysis and High Power  mode that upgrades Agent to Claude Opus. Together, these features help you get first-try correct results on complex builds.

Dynamic Intelligence features are designed for builders who value quality over speed. Both features increase costs but deliver better results for complex tasks. This means that you’ll get better results and it may take fewer turns to get there, though the cost of those turns will be higher.

## ​What is Dynamic Intelligence?

Dynamic Intelligence gives you two powerful ways to enhance Agent’s capabilities:

- Extended Thinking: Provides deeper reasoning and analysis for complex problems
- High Power mode: Upgrades Agent to Claude Opus for maximum capability

Use these features independently or together to tackle demanding development tasks with higher accuracy and better outcomes.

## ​Extended Thinking

Extended Thinking  gives Agent more reasoning capacity for complex problems. Agent considers multiple approaches, analyzes edge cases, and plans comprehensive solutions before implementing code.

Use Extended Thinking for:

- Architectural decisions: Planning system design or choosing between frameworks
- Complex integrations: Unfamiliar APIs or authentication flows
- Robust error handling: Comprehensive user scenarios and edge cases
- Performance optimization: Analyzing bottlenecks and implementing efficient solutions

## ​High Power mode

High Power  upgrades Agent from Claude Sonnet to Claude Opus, Anthropic’s most capable model. Opus provides superior performance for complex reasoning, large context processing, and sophisticated problem-solving.

Use High Power for:

- Maximum accuracy: Critical business logic or security implementations
- Large context processing: Working with entire codebases or extensive documentation
- Complex algorithms: Multi-step processes or sophisticated data processing
- Advanced integrations: Complex API interactions or third-party service integrations

Extended Thinking uses the same model rates but generates more output tokens due to deeper analysis, this costs  the cost of standard Agent. High Power costs approximately  the cost of standard Agent.

## ​How to use Dynamic Intelligence

1. Open Agent in your Replit App.
1. Locate the Dynamic Intelligence controls in the chat toolbar.
1. Toggle  Extended Thinking on to enable deeper reasoning.
1. Optionally, toggle  High Power to upgrade to Claude Opus.
1. Send your prompt. The settings will apply to your next request.

### ​Cost transparency

Both Dynamic Intelligence features provide clear cost information. For High Power requests over , you’ll see an upfront estimate before the request begins. Monitor your spending with detailed breakdowns per request, and view current token costs in the sidebar history.

To manage costs effectively:

- Start selective: Use Dynamic Intelligence for complex tasks where quality matters most
- Monitor usage: Check the usage icon to track spending on enhanced requests
- Mix approaches: Use standard Agent for simple tasks and Dynamic Intelligence for complex ones

### ​Usage limits

Dynamic Intelligence features have usage limits based on your plan:

- Free plan:  High Power requests per day
- Pro plan:  High Power requests per day
- Teams/Enterprise: Unlimited usage with soft alerts at  requests

Extended Thinking counts toward your standard token usage limits.

## ​When to use Dynamic Intelligence

### ​Use Extended Thinking for:

- Large-scale refactoring: Projects requiring careful planning and multiple approach consideration
- Complex business logic: Implementation where edge cases and error handling are critical
- Architecture planning: Multi-service designs involving trade-offs between solutions
- Integration challenges: Working with unfamiliar APIs or authentication systems

### ​Use High Power when you need:

- Maximum accuracy: Critical business logic or security implementations
- Large context processing: Working with entire codebases or extensive documentation
- Complex problem solving: Multi-step algorithms or sophisticated data processing
- Advanced integrations: Complex API interactions or third-party service integrations

### ​Use standard Agent for:

- Simple bug fixes and basic feature additions
- Straightforward UI changes and file organization tasks
- Quick modifications that don’t require deep analysis

## ​Best practices

### ​Optimizing prompts for Dynamic Intelligence

- Provide comprehensive context: Upload related files, documentation, or examples
- Describe constraints: Mention performance requirements, compatibility needs, or business rules
- Ask for analysis: Request that Agent explain trade-offs and consider alternatives
- Specify quality requirements: Mention if you need production-ready, testable, or maintainable code

### ​Getting the most value

- Start simple: Try Extended Thinking on a moderately complex task to see the difference
- Compare results: Use both standard and Dynamic Intelligence modes on similar tasks to understand the value
- Monitor usage patterns: Track when you use these features to optimize your workflow
- Scale gradually: Once comfortable, apply Dynamic Intelligence to your most challenging builds

## ​Next steps

Ready to enhance your development workflow with Dynamic Intelligence? Start by enabling these features for your next complex build and experience the difference in quality and accuracy.
