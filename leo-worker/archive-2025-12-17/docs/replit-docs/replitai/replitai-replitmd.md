Featuresreplit.mdCopy pagereplit.md is a special file that customizes Agent’s behavior in your project. Define your preferences, coding style, and project context to help Agent build exactly what you want.Copy page

Agent automatically creates this file in your project’s root directory using proven best practices. Agent includes its contents in the context to help it understand your preferences, project structure, and coding style.

## ​How replit.md works

Agent first creates a replit.md file in your project’s root directory using proven best practices. This file includes:

- Basic project information
- Recommended coding patterns
- Common preferences for your project type

When Agent processes your requests, it automatically reads your replit.md file and uses its contents to:

- Understand your project’s architecture and conventions
- Follow your preferred coding patterns and style
- Use your specified package managers and dependencies

Agent can also update your replit.md file as it learns more about your project and makes changes to your application.

You can edit the replit.md file to customize Agent’s behavior.

## ​Setting up replit.md

### ​Automatic generation

When you create a new project with Agent, it automatically generates a replit.md file using proven best practices. This file appears in your project’s root directory and includes:

- Basic project information
- Recommended coding patterns
- Common preferences for your project type

### ​Manual creation

You can create your own replit.md file by adding a new file named replit.md in your project’s root directory. Agent will automatically detect and use this file in future conversations.

replit.md must be located in your project’s root directory to work properly.

### ​Regenerating replit.md

If your replit.md file becomes corrupted or you want to start fresh:

1. Delete the existing replit.md file from your project root
1. Start a new conversation with Agent
1. Agent will automatically generate a new replit.md file based on your current project

## ​Best practices

### ​Be specific and clear

Write clear, specific instructions that help Agent understand exactly what you want:

Copy

Ask AI

```
## Coding Style

- Use TypeScript for all new JavaScript files
- Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, avoid inline styles
- Always include TypeScript types for function parameters and return values

```

For a more detailed guide on prompt formatting, check out the Anthropic prompt engineering guide.

### ​Use examples

Examples help Agent understand your preferences better than abstract descriptions:

Copy

Ask AI

```
## API Error Handling

When creating API endpoints, always use this error handling pattern:

```javascript
app.get('/api/users', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const users = await getUsersFromDatabase();
    res.json({ success: true, data: users });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching users:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ 
      success: false, 
      error: 'Failed to fetch users' 
    });
  }
});

```

### ​Define communication preferences

Tell Agent how you prefer to receive information and updates:

Copy

Ask AI

```
## Communication Style

- Before implementing changes, explain what you're going to do and why
- Break down complex tasks into clear steps
- Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
- Provide brief explanations for technical decisions

```

### ​Specify project context

Help Agent understand your project’s purpose and constraints:

Copy

Ask AI

```
## Project Context

- Create reading lists and share book recommendations
- Follow other readers and see their updates
- Rate and review books they've read

Target audience: Casual readers aged 25-45
Tech stack: React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database

```

```

## ​Advanced usage

### ​Dynamic project guidance

Update your replit.md file as your project evolves to provide current context:

Copy

Ask AI

```
## Current Development Phase
The team is currently focused on implementing user authentication.
Priority features:
1. User registration and login
2. Password reset functionality  
3. Email verification

## Recent Decisions
- Switched from local authentication to OAuth with Google
- Added Redux for state management
- Decided to use Material-UI for consistent styling

```

### ​Integration with external tools

Reference external documentation and tools in your replit.md:

Copy

Ask AI

```
## External Resources
- Design system: Follow the Figma design system at [link]
- API documentation: Reference our internal API docs
- Coding standards: Follow the team style guide in our wiki

## Deployment Process
- Test changes in development environment first
- Use the CI/CD pipeline for staging published apps
- Require code review before production releases

```

## ​Combining web search with replit.md

Agent can perform web searches to find current information, libraries, and solutions. When combined with your replit.md file, you get both up-to-date knowledge and project-specific guidance.

### ​Best practices for web search integration

Be specific about what you want Agent to research:

Copy

Ask AI

```
## Research Preferences
- Always check for the latest versions of dependencies before suggesting updates
- Research current best practices for security implementations
- Look up recent performance optimization techniques for our tech stack

```

Guide Agent on how to apply external knowledge:

Copy

Ask AI

```
## External Research Guidelines
- When suggesting new libraries, ensure compatibility with our existing stack
- Adapt external examples to match our coding standards and project structure  
- Verify that suggested solutions work with our publishing environment

```

Example request that leverages both:
“Research the latest React 18 performance optimization techniques and implement them following the component patterns defined in replit.md”

This approach gives you solutions that are both current and tailored to your specific project needs.

## ​Limitations

### ​File size and content limits

While there’s no strict character limit for replit.md, extremely large files may not be fully processed. Keep your replit.md focused and concise for best results.

### ​Root directory requirement

replit.md must exist in your project’s root directory. Agent won’t automatically detect files in subdirectories.

### ​Context scope

replit.md provides context for Agent conversations but doesn’t automatically apply to other AI tools like Assistant.

## ​Next steps

Ready to customize Agent for your project?

1. Start simple: Create a basic replit.md with your key preferences
1. Iterate and improve: Update your replit.md as you work with Agent
1. Share patterns: Use successful replit.md configurations across similar projects
1. Monitor effectiveness: Pay attention to how well Agent follows your guidelines and adjust accordingly
