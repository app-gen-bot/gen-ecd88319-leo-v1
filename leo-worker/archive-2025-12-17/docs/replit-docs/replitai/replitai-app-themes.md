App Themes allows you to customize your app’s visual appearance with personalized or preset color schemes. Whether you’re starting a new app or updating an existing one, you can create, manage, and apply themes to match your vision.

Certain preview elements were inspired by tweakcn. Check out the public open-source software repository here from Sahaj Jain.

## ​Team and Organization Themes

App Themes work differently depending on whether you’re using a personal account or working within an organization.

### ​Personal themes

When using App Themes on a personal account, all themes you create are private to your account. You have full control over creating, editing, and deleting your custom themes.

### ​Organization themes

App Themes in organizations enable collaborative design across your team:

- Shared access: Themes created by any organization member are available to everyone in the organization
- Collaborative editing: All users with edit permissions can create and modify organization themes
- Admin controls: Only organization administrators can delete themes to prevent accidental removal of shared resources

Organization themes help maintain consistent branding and design standards across all apps built by your team.
