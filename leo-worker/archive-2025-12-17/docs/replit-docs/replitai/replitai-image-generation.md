Create visual content for your applications using Agent’s image generation  capabilities.

Transform your ideas into custom images, illustrations, and graphics that perfectly match your project’s needs. Whether you’re building a website, mobile app, or any creative project, Agent generates images that bring your vision to life.

Image generation empowers builders to create unique visual content without needing design skills or external tools. Generate everything from icons and illustrations to backgrounds and UI elements directly within your development workflow.

## ​Features

Build visually compelling applications with Agent’s image generation. This eliminates the need for stock photos, external design tools, or hiring designers for basic visual content. Whether you’re creating a portfolio website, building a game, or designing a mobile app interface, image generation provides custom visuals tailored to your project.

Agent can perform the following image generation actions:

- Custom image creation: Generate images based on detailed descriptions and specifications
- Style adaptation: Create images in various artistic styles, from realistic to cartoon-like
- Project integration: Seamlessly add generated images directly to your app’s codebase
- Iterative refinement: Modify and improve images based on your feedback

## ​Usage

To enable image generation and start creating custom images:

1. Open any Replit App with Agent enabled
1. Look for  Agent Tools at the bottom right of the Agent pane
1. Enable  Image generation
1. Chat with Agent and ask it to generate images for your project

Agent automatically determines when to use image generation based on your requests. Describe the visual content you need, and Agent creates custom images that match your specifications.

### ​Project integration

Agent seamlessly integrates generated images into your codebase:

- Automatic file creation: Generated images are saved directly to your project files
- Code updates: Agent updates your code to reference the new image files
- Asset organization: Images are placed in logical directories within your project structure

This streamlined workflow means you can generate and implement visual content without leaving your development environment.

Replit’s image generation is powered by Google’s Imagen 4, a state-of-the-art text-to-image model that excels at creating high-quality, photorealistic images with fine details and improved text rendering capabilities.
