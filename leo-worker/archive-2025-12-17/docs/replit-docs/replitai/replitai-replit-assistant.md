Assistant uses powerful AI technology to understand your Replit App and help you code more efficiently. Whether you need quick explanations or complex code modifications, Assistant adapts to your needs with two flexible modes.

## ​Features

Assistant offers Basic and Advanced modes to support different development needs and budgets.

Assistant uses the following industry-leading AI models:

- Intelligent autocomplete: Receive smart suggestions as you type
- Best practices: Get recommendations to improve your code quality
- Debugging help: Identify potential issues and get guidance on fixes

Perfect for learning, understanding existing code, and getting development guidance.

### ​Advanced mode ( per edit request)

Take your development to the next level with Assistant’s ability to directly modify your code:

  paperclip icon
- Specific file context: Select Add file context to reference particular files related to your request

While Assistant intelligently determines relevant files, specifying them helps create more accurate solutions.

#### ​Edit requests (Advanced mode only)

In Advanced mode, Assistant creates edit requests when proposing code changes.
These requests provide transparency and control over modifications to your app:

- Preview changes: See exactly what Assistant plans to modify before approval
- Selective approval: Choose which changes to apply and which to skip
- Automatic checkpoints: Comprehensive snapshots capture workspace contents, AI context, and database states for approved changes
- Easy rollbacks: Undo changes or restore to previous states across your entire development environment

When Assistant suggests changes:

1. Select  Preview code changes to review
1. Select Apply all to implement the changes
1. Use Undo these changes if you need to reverse the modifications

For detailed information about checkpoints, rollback capabilities, and what gets restored, see Checkpoints and Rollbacks.

Each approved edit request in Advanced mode costs .

You’re only charged when you approve and apply changes - previewing and reviewing edit requests is always free.
