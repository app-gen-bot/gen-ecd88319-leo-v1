## ​Import your GitHub repository

⏰ Estimated time: two minutes

You can import your GitHub repositories and turn them into Replit Apps to
run, test, and publish your code. This quickstart covers the fastest methods to get your GitHub projects running on Replit.

For comprehensive import options including other platforms like Figma, Bolt, and Lovable, see the Import feature documentation.

## ​Rapid import

Rapid import works instantly with public repositories.
Combine the Replit import URL with your GitHub repository URL to start the import process.

Import using rapid import

Copy the repository GitHub URL, starting with github.com.


Type https://replit.com/ in the browser address bar and paste your copied GitHub URL at the end (no spaces).
Example:
GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/exampleUser/my-app
Import URL: https://replit.com/github.com/exampleUser/my-app


Press Enter to start the automatic import process.

## ​Guided import

and supports public and private repositories.
