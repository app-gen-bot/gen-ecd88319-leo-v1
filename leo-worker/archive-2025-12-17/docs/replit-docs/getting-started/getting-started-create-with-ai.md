## ​Create your app using AI

⏰ Estimated time: 7 minutes

Learn how to create your Replit App using the Agent and Assistant AI tools in this guide.

## Agent

Specializes in generating new projects and building complex features.

## Assistant

Specializes in describing your code, making quick fixes, and adding new features.

Follow the steps below to build a polished business website. Use Replit’s
AI features to create an app, and refine it until it matches your desired design.

1

Create an App

Navigate to the Home screen and select Create App:

Select the Create with Replit Agent tab as shown in the following image:

2

Craft your prompt

To ask Agent to create your Replit App, enter your prompt in the text area.
A prompt is a description of the task you want AI to perform.

You can include text and file attachments in your prompt. Follow these steps to submit both in your prompt:

1. Copy the following image:
1. Paste the image into Agent text area.
1. Enter the following prompt in the text area:
CopyAsk AIBuild a website for a SaaS B2B website that looks like the attached file.
1. Select Start building.

3

Review and approve Agent's plan

After you submit your prompt, Agent sets up your Replit App and provides updates on its status in real time.
You can monitor and view the history in the Progress tab.

When Agent finishes setup, it prompts you with what it intends to build and options to include additional features as shown in the following image:

Leave the additional options unchecked and select Approve plan & start.

4

Test the app

After Agent builds your app, navigate to the Preview tab, where you can interact with the website.
The website should resemble the following image:

The generated website might differ since Agent can return different results for the same prompt.

Since the prompt only includes information about the landing page, Agent might omit content creation for the links on the page.

The next step demonstrates how to use Assistant to add those pages.

5

Improve the app using the Assistant

Navigate to the Assistant tab, which should resemble the following image:

Enter the following prompt in the text area and submit it:

Copy

Ask AI

```
Create pages for each of the links in the navigation bar.
```

You can select Preview code changes to view the Assistant’s planned changes.

Select Apply All and confirm your selection if prompted.

Assistant and Agent, which rely on popular AI models, occasionally produce results that don’t fulfill your request.
If you encounter issues, follow up with a prompt that describes the error messages or the incorrect behavior.
Alternatively, you can use the Rollback feature to restore your Replit App to a previously known working state.

At this point, you should have a navigable website that includes sample text and functional links.

## ​Explore

Try the tasks in the following sections to build your knowledge of Replit.

### ​Undo an Agent change

Agent lets you perform a rollback, a feature that reverts your app to a previous checkpoint, discarding all changes made after that point.
Follow these steps to revert the app to a specific checkpoint:

When you use the rollback feature, you restore the Replit App to a previous state. This action removes all changes made after that point. This includes edits by you or the AI-powered features, as well as any database changes and AI conversation context. The rollback affects your entire development environment.

For detailed information about checkpoints and rollbacks, see Checkpoints and Rollbacks.

1

Locate the checkpoint

Navigate to the Agent tab and locate the checkpoint you want to restore.

Select Rollback to here to undo all changes after that point as shown in the following image:

2

Verify the rollback

After Agent completes your request, check that the Agent tab displays “Rollback completed”.

Confirm that your app functionality matches its state before the checkpoint.

### ​Undo an Assistant change

Assistant lets you perform a rollback, a feature that reverts your app to a previous checkpoint, discarding all changes made after that point.
Follow these steps to revert the app to a specific checkpoint:

When you use the rollback feature, you restore the Replit App to a previous state. This action removes all changes made after that point. This includes edits by you or the AI-powered features, as well as any database changes and AI conversation context. The rollback affects your entire development environment.

1

Locate the checkpoint

Navigate to the Assistant tab and locate the checkpoint you want to restore.

Select Undo these changes* to revert all changes from the checkpoint after that point in time as shown in the following image:

2

Verify the rollback

After Assistant completes your request, the Undo these changes button label should be replaced with Restore checkpoint.

Confirm that your app functionality matches its state before the checkpoint.

## ​Continue your journey
