Transfer your personal Replit Apps to team workspaces to enable collaboration and centralized project management. This process allows you to:

- Share apps with team members instantly
- Centralize project management within your organization
- Maintain deployment uptime and URLs during transfer

## ​What is app transfer?

App transfer moves ownership of a Replit App from your personal workspace to a team workspace. Once transferred, the app becomes accessible to team members according to workspace permissions and is managed under the team’s resources and billing.

The transfer process is immediate and irreversible, but maintains all deployment configurations and URLs.

## ​Getting started

You must be a member of the target team workspace before transferring apps. Verify your team membership by selecting your profile or workspace selector in the upper-right corner to view available teams.

- Transferring a Replit App to a team workspace is irreversible
- Published apps experience zero downtime during transfer
- Deployment URLs remain unchanged
- You must be a member of the team you want to transfer the app to before initiating transfer

## ​How it works

1

Access your Apps

Navigate to your personal Apps by selecting the Apps tab from your Replit home page.

2

Select the app

Locate the application you want to transfer in your Apps list.

Open transfer options

Select the three dots (•••) menu next to the app name.

- Core to team workspace: Use org transfer-repls
