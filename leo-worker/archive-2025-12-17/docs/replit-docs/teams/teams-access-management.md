Replit App access may be managed either from the group permissions interface, or from the workspace using the “Access” button in the header. Users with edit access can change the role for existing groups or individuals, or add roles to new groups or users. All users with access to the Replit App workspace are able to see who has access to the Replit App, even if they can’t manage it.

To grant access to a group or member, use the search to locate them by name or username.

After selecting the result, a dropdown for the role selection will appear. After choosing the role, the group or user will be added to the “Groups with access” or “People with access” sections below.

This popover also controls whether the Replit App is private or public, using selector in the bottom left corner. If the Replit App is marked as internal, it is private within the organization. Only users with access can see that it exists. If the Replit App is public, anyone on Replit (regardless of whether they are logged in) can see, but not edit, the Replit App.
