## ​About viewer seats

Viewers get read-only access to your team’s apps and deployments. This makes it easier to share your work with stakeholders and collaborators who don’t need edit permissions or a full team license.

Viewer seats are perfect for:

- Internal tool users who are not creating applications
- Stakeholders who need to review project progress
- Teammates who are exploring capabilities of Replit

Teams get 50 viewer seats included in their plan, allowing you to scale your collaboration efficiently.

If you would like to add more than 50 viewers, contact our sales team at sales@replit.com regarding an Enterprise plan.

## ​Inviting a viewer

1. Navigate to the Members tab in your Organization
1. Select + Add
1. Choose the Viewer option
1. Enter the email addresses of viewers you would like to add in a comma-separated list
1. Select Send invites

Invited users without a Replit account will receive an email with instructions to create an account and join your team. Users who already have a Replit account will be added automatically.

## ​Viewer access

Updated Default Access Behavior (Effective June 9, 2025): Apps created in organizations will now be private by default. Viewers will need to be explicitly granted access to new apps through the Access panel.

Viewers will need to be explicitly granted access to new apps through the Access panel. For existing apps created before this change, viewers may still have access based on previous settings.
