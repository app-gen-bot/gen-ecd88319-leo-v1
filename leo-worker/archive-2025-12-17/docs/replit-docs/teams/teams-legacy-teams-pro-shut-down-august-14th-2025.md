Legacy Teams Pro shut down (August 14th, 2025)Copy pageCopy page

## ​Overview

Replit’s Legacy Teams Pro product will sunset on August 14th, 2025. This timeline has been extended from the previously announced date of July 31st, 2025. After this date, you will lose access to both the legacy Teams Pro service and your team’s data on the platform. We understand this may impact your workflow and want to ensure you have time to export your data and explore our new Teams experience.

Since the launch of the new Replit Teams, Legacy Teams Pro has been in maintenance mode. Over the past year, we’ve shifted  focus to making AI-powered software creation accessible to everyone, while moving away from developing tools for interviewing and classroom education.

## ​Export your data

Download all your team’s projects and content using our export tool before the shutdown date.
