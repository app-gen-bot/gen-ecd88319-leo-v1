## ​Transferring Replit Apps to Organizations

You can transfer personal and Legacy Teams Replit Apps to your Organization using the CLUI tool.

- Transferring a Replit App to an Organization is irreversible.
- If your Replit App is published you should experience zero downtime, the published service will not change, and the URLs to your published app will not change.

You will only be able to transfer the Replit App if:

- you have permission to view and delete the Replit App
- you have permission to create Replit Apps in the target Organization
- you have permission to publish Replit Apps in the target Organization

### ​Steps

- Get your Organization ID by visiting your Org’s profile settings page:

- Copy the URL(s) of the Replit App(s) you want to transfer.
- Go to the org transfer-repls CLUI tool.
- Provide the Organization ID and Replit App(s) (space separated) and submit the request.
- The output will indicate whether the transfer was successful. Visit your Organization homepage, Replit App and Deployments to verify the transfer. You might need to refresh the page for it to update.

Occasionally, a Replit App might fail to republish. This will not cause downtime for your published app. You can rerun the transfer on the Replit App again or republish from the Deployments pane.
