## ​Replit Teams Billing

Replit Teams plans have two parts of their billing: Seats and Usage-Based costs. Both are charged at the same time on the same invoice. To see your historic and upcoming bills, visit the usage page.

An invoice will have:

- The upfront seat cost for the current billing period
- The usage-based costs for the previous billing period

## ​Seat pricing

Seats are a fixed fee per user per billing period. Each seat comes with a monthly spend credit, which is currently  per user per month.

## ​Usage-Based pricing

Visit our Usage-Based docs for more information.
