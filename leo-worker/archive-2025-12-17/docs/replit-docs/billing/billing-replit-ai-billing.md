Replit AI features use usage-based billing to charge you based on what you build and how much you use our AI-powered tools. This ensures you only pay for the value you receive from Agent and Assistant.

## ​Getting started

All subscribers receive one-time free Agent checkpoints and Advanced Assistant edit requests.

Additional monthly credits automatically apply to AI usage:

- Core subscribers:  per month
- Teams subscribers:  per user per month

These credits cover Agent, Advanced Assistant, and other Replit cloud services like published apps, storage, and databases.

## ​Agent billing

Replit Agent uses effort-based pricing that scales with the complexity of your request. You pay based on the actual work Agent performs, ensuring fair pricing whether you’re making small tweaks or building complex features. This same pricing applies to all Agent usage, including Plan Mode conversations.

### ​How effort-based pricing works

When you chat with Agent, it creates meaningful checkpoints that capture completed work on your request:

- Simple requests (like bug fixes or small changes) typically cost less than the previous  fixed price
- Complex builds (like full features or integrations) are bundled into one checkpoint that may cost more than  but reflect the total effort involved
- One checkpoint per request eliminates intermediate checkpoints and reduces billing noise
- Transparent pricing shows you exactly what you’re paying for each completed task

A checkpoint occurs when Agent completes work on your request and implements the requested functionality in your code.

For detailed information about what checkpoints capture and how they work, see Checkpoints and Rollbacks.

### ​Advanced capabilities

For complex projects, you can enable Dynamic Intelligence features on a per-request basis:

Extended ThinkingPart of Dynamic Intelligence. Instructs Agent to analyze your request more deeply and consider additional approaches. Best for complex architectural decisions or when you need Agent to think through multiple implementation options.

High Power ModePart of Dynamic Intelligence. Upgrades Agent to Claude Opus for advanced problem-solving. Ideal for complex integrations, performance optimizations, or when working with unfamiliar technologies.

These Dynamic Intelligence features increase the effort Agent expends and therefore the cost, but they’re designed to save you time and deliver better solutions for complex builds.

### ​Track your usage

You can monitor your Agent spending in real-time:

1. Agent tab: View costs for individual checkpoints by hovering over the usage icon
1. Usage dashboard: See detailed billing information for the current period
1. Account settings: Set up alerts and budgets to control spending

Usage data can take up to 30 minutes to appear on your usage dashboard.

## ​Assistant billing

Replit Assistant offers two modes to support different development needs:

### ​Basic Assistant

Get quick answers to coding questions, explanations of concepts, and general programming help at no cost.

### ​Advanced Assistant

Request specific code changes, feature implementations, and error fixes. Each edit request that modifies your code costs  and counts as a billable action.

An edit request occurs when you ask Advanced Assistant to make specific changes to your code, like building a feature or fixing an error.

You can track Assistant usage the same way as Agent usage through the Assistant tab or your usage dashboard.

## ​Managing your spend

Take control of your AI spending with Replit’s built-in budget tools:

- Usage alerts: Get notified when you reach spending thresholds
- Budget limits: Set hard caps to prevent unexpected charges
- Real-time tracking: Monitor costs as you build
