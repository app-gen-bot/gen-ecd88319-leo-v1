You have the option to establish a monthly usage alert and usage budget for usage-based billing services to control your costs.

### ​User usage alerts

Usage alerts are a simple way to get a heads-up when you hit a certain spending amount beyond your monthly credits. You will be notified when you hit the set amount on Replit and via email.

Visit your account page or usage page to set up a usage alert.

### ​User budgets

Budgets are a hard cap on your monthly spending. Once your budget is met or exceeded, we will send you an email notification and temporarily suspend all of your usage-based services. After suspension, you will have 30 days to update your budget and resume deployments until they are deleted. Suspended deployments are not automatically resumed, you must resume each deployment once your budget is no longer exceeded.

Visit your account page or usage page to set up a budget.

### ​Organization budgets
