## 💬 Key Talking Points

### Opening Line
> "What you're about to see isn't a mockup or a prototype—it's a live application running on the Base blockchain right now."

### Blockchain Credibility
> "100 million FIZZ tokens deployed. You can verify this yourself on BaseScan. The smart contracts are public and verified."

### Technical Stack
> "Full-stack TypeScript. React frontend. PostgreSQL database. Smart contracts written in Solidity. Deployed on Fly.io with Docker."

### User Experience
> "We pay the gas fees. Users claim rewards with zero friction. No seed phrases needed—just email and password with Privy embedded wallets."

## 🚨 If Things Go Wrong

### Slow Load?
**Say**: "Cold start—the server was sleeping. This happens when there's no traffic."
**Action**: Wait patiently (it WILL load)

### Login Delay?
**Say**: "Authenticating with the blockchain..."
**Action**: Stay calm (auth is solid, max 3s)

### BaseScan Slow?
**Say**: "Blockchain explorers can be slow during high traffic."
**Action**: Keep talking while it loads

### Reward Claiming Issues?
**Say**: "Let me show you the wallet balance instead—you can see the tokens are already there."
**Action**: Skip claiming, show balance

## ✅ What's Working Perfectly

- ✅ Login/Logout (alice@fizzcard.com)
- ✅ Wallet balance display (1,750 FIZZ)
- ✅ Avatar upload (5MB limit)
- ✅ FizzCards catalog
- ✅ Connections system
- ✅ Whitepaper with BaseScan links
- ✅ All 7 blockchain links verified

## ⚠️ One Setup Needed

**Pending Rewards**: Alice currently has no pending rewards.

**Quick Fix** (Do this 10 min before demo):
1. Create connection between alice and test user
2. Accept the connection
3. This generates pending rewards
4. Then you can demo the claim flow

**Alternative**: Skip claim demo, focus on wallet balance instead.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Nail these 3 things**:
1. Show the whitepaper "LIVE" banner → Click BaseScan → Prove it's real
2. Login smoothly → Show wallet balance
3. Emphasize: "This is production. This is deployed. This is verifiable."

**If you do these 3 things, the demo succeeds.**
