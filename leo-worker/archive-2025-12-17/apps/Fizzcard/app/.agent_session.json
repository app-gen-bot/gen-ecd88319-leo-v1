        "task": "The changelog shows your demo is tomorrow and the site is production-ready with all blockchain infrastructure deployed and verified on Base Sepolia testnet. You've successfully completed comprehensive testing that validated FizzCoin (100M supply) and FizzCoinRewards (50M pool) contracts are live with verified BaseScan entries, all blockchain features work end-to-end including wallet creation via Privy, balance display, and gasless reward claiming, and you've even enhanced the whitepaper page to showcase the live deployment with working BaseScan links. The last session ended with whitepaper updates being deployed and validated. At this critical juncture before your demo, the highest priority is ensuring you have absolute confidence in the production system's stability and that you've practiced the actual demo flow to identify any potential issues that might arise during the live presentation.\n\nDelegate to the **quality_assurer** subagent for a final pre-demo validation sweep of the production site at fizzcard.fly.dev using Chrome DevTools. They should execute the complete demo flow you'll present tomorrow using the alice@fizzcard.com account: verify login works smoothly without delays, test FizzCard creation with avatar upload (since you fixed that bug earlier), attempt to make a connection request and accept it to trigger reward earning, navigate to the wallet page to confirm the pending reward appears correctly, execute a claim transaction and verify it completes with a transaction hash, check that the whitepaper page loads properly with all BaseScan links working, and monitor the browser console throughout the entire flow for any warnings or errors that could distract during the demo. They should also test the leaderboard page to ensure it displays correctly, verify all navigation links work, check page load times to ensure nothing feels sluggish, and test on both desktop and mobile viewports if you might demo on different devices. Document any issues found with severity ratings (critical/minor) and note the exact reproduction steps so you can either fix them before tomorrow or know to avoid those specific actions during the demo.\n\nIf the quality_assurer discovers any critical issues that would hurt the demo, immediately delegate to the **error_fixer** subagent to diagnose and implement fixes with extreme urgency. For minor UI polish issues or non-blocking improvements, document them for post-demo work but don't risk destabilizing the system with last-minute changes. Once validation is complete and you're confident the production system is stable, consider doing a final dry-run of your demo script using the DEMO-ACCOUNT-GUIDE.md documentation to ensure the talking points align with what the system actually does and that you can smoothly navigate through the blockchain features without hesitation. The goal is to walk into tomorrow's demo with zero surprises and complete confidence that every feature you showcase will work flawlessly.",
