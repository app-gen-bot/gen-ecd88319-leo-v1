## Important Caveats to Mention

If asked about balance being 0:
> "This is a fresh test account. In production, users earn FIZZ by making connections and introductions. The rewards accumulate in the smart contract and users can claim them anytime."

If asked about testnet:
> "We deployed on Base Sepolia testnet for safety and testing. Switching to mainnet is just an environment variable change - we're production-ready."

If asked about Privy:
> "Privy handles embedded wallet creation and security. Users don't need MetaMask or seed phrases - they just use their email."
