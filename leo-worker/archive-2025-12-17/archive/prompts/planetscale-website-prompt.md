# Build PlanetScale Company Website

Create a stunning, ultra-modern website for PlanetScale, an AI-powered app factory that transforms text prompts into production-ready applications.

## Core Concept
PlanetScale uses our proprietary "Adaptive Code Evolution (ACE)" system - a breakthrough AI approach that learns and improves with every application built, similar to how neural networks use backpropagation. We democratize software development by providing a "technical co-founder in a box."

## Design Requirements
- **Style**: Ultra-minimalist, sophisticated, impressive
- **Color Scheme**: Monochromatic (black, white, grays) with electric blue (#0080FF) accents
- **Typography**: Use Inter for body, Cal Sans or similar for headlines
- **Dark Mode**: Default dark theme with smooth light mode toggle
- **Animations**: Subtle parallax scrolling, smooth hover effects, elegant transitions
- **Layout**: Generous whitespace, perfect visual hierarchy

## Pages & Sections
