# PlanetScale Website - Company Landing Page

## Company Overview
PlanetScale is an AI-powered app factory that transforms simple text prompts into production-ready applications that scale effortlessly from 10 to 10 million users. We've revolutionized software development through our proprietary Adaptive Code Evolution (ACE) system - a breakthrough approach that learns and improves with every application it builds.

## Core Value Proposition
**"From Prompt to Planet Scale"**

With PlanetScale, you don't just get an app - you get a business-ready solution with enterprise-grade security, infinite scalability, and zero technical debt. Our AI doesn't just code; it architects, optimizes, and evolves.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Adaptive Code Evolution (ACE)
Unlike traditional AI coding tools that rely on static patterns, PlanetScale employs ACE - our revolutionary learning system inspired by neural network backpropagation. Every application built teaches our system new patterns, edge cases, and optimizations. When an issue is discovered, ACE traces back through the development pipeline to identify where improvements can be made, ensuring future applications are even more robust.

### 2. Zero-Iteration Development
Forget the endless back-and-forth with AI coding assistants. Our multi-agent orchestration with strict compliance criteria ensures your application is production-ready on the first try. No more "almost working" code - just polished, professional applications.

### 3. Enterprise-Grade by Default
Every PlanetScale application comes with:
- AWS-native architecture optimized for global scale
- Zero-trust security model with encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using AWS CDK
- Automated CI/CD pipelines
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- DDoS protection and WAF integration

### 4. Your Technical Co-Founder
PlanetScale democratizes entrepreneurship. Whether you're pitching to VCs or bootstrapping your dream, we provide the technical excellence that traditionally required a full engineering team. Business in a box, powered by AI.

## Technical Excellence

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
Our system employs specialized AI agents, each mastering a specific domain:
- **Hermes**: Our coding virtuoso that writes clean, maintainable code
- **Athena**: Architecture specialist ensuring scalable design patterns
- **Minerva**: Security expert implementing best practices
- **Apollo**: Performance optimizer for lightning-fast applications

### Intelligent Context Management
Our agents don't work in isolation. They share context, learn from each other, and maintain perfect coherence across the entire codebase. No more conflicting implementations or forgotten edge cases.
