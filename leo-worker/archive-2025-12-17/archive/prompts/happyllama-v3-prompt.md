# Prompt for Generating a PRD for Happy Llama Marketing Website

**IMPORTANT: This is a MARKETING WEBSITE for Happy Llama, NOT the actual Happy Llama platform itself.**

You are an AI product strategist tasked with creating a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for the Happy Llama **marketing website**. This website will explain what Happy Llama is, how it works, showcase its benefits, and collect beta signups from interested users.

Happy Llama is a multi-agent AI platform that allows **anyone**—from citizen developers to enterprises—to build end-to-end applications. The key differentiator is that **all apps, regardless of scale, are built with the same rigor as enterprise systems**. This is not about "toy apps in minutes," but about building explainable, type-safe, and reliable apps **at the speed of AI**.

**The website you're designing is the MARKETING SITE that will:**
- Explain what Happy Llama does
- Showcase how it works
- Highlight key benefits and differentiators
- Collect beta signup information
- Build trust and excitement about the platform

**You are NOT building:**
- The actual Happy Llama platform
- The multi-agent system itself
- The code generation tools
- The agent orchestration system

When creating the PRD for this marketing website, follow these instructions:

## Context & Positioning

* Happy Llama is for **everyone**: citizen developers, startups, and enterprises.
* The promise: *"Your thoughts → fully functioning applications, built with enterprise-grade rigor."*
* Emphasize that apps are explainable, type-safe, and always documented.
* Remove any mention of investors or fundraising.

## Key Differentiators (to include in PRD)

1. **For Everyone, With Enterprise Rigor**

   * Citizen developers: build quickly and creatively.
   * Enterprises: rely on governance, compliance, and reliability.
   * All apps follow the same disciplined process.

2. **Learning Across Builds (Backprop-inspired)**

   * Agents learn from every app built (abstracted patterns, not raw code).
   * Future builds converge faster, with fewer retries.

3. **Incredible Memory System**

   * Hierarchical memory ensures efficiency.
   * Optimized recall keeps costs low and accuracy high.

4. **Explainability & Documentation by Default**

   * Every decision and change has a document trail.
   * Contracts, type-safety, and PR rationales are enforced.

## How It Works Section (For the Marketing Website)

* The marketing website should have a section that explains how Happy Llama follows **standard SDLC principles**:

  * **Requirements → PRDs**
  * **Design → Technical specs, UI/UX docs**
  * **Implementation → Code & tests**
  * **Verification → QA, explainability reports**
  * **Deployment → Release with documentation**
* Highlight that **all required documents (PRDs, technical docs, UI/UX specs)** are generated automatically.
* This "documented by design" approach ensures that every decision is explainable and backed by an artifact.
* Result: an AI-driven SDLC that happens at **AI speed**.

## Output Format for Marketing Website PRD

When the AI creates the PRD for the **marketing website**, it should include:

1. **Purpose & Goals**
2. **Audience & Use Cases**
3. **Positioning Statement**
4. **Messaging Pillars**
5. **User Journeys (Visitor paths through the marketing site)**
6. **How It Works Page (explaining the platform's SDLC approach)**
7. **Platform Differentiators Page (showcasing Learning, Memory, Rigor)**
8. **Site Structure (Home, How It Works, Platform, For Builders, For Enterprises, Join Beta, Docs/Blog)**
9. **Sample Marketing Copy (Hero headline, subhead, CTA variants)**
10. **Beta Signup Form (email, company, use case, etc.)**
11. **Privacy & Legal Pages (Beta form transparency, terms)**

## Final Prompt

**Prompt for AI Agent:**

"Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Happy Llama **MARKETING WEBSITE**. This is the public-facing marketing site that will promote and explain the Happy Llama platform - NOT the platform itself. 

Happy Llama is a multi-agent AI platform that empowers anyone—from citizen developers to enterprises—to turn their ideas into production-grade apps at the speed of AI. 

The marketing website must:
- Explain what Happy Llama is and how it works
- Communicate that apps are always built with enterprise-level rigor, explainability, and type-safety
- Showcase the platform's key differentiators
- Include a beta signup form to collect interested users
- NOT implement the actual platform functionality - this is purely a marketing/informational site

Structure the PRD with sections for purpose, goals, audiences, positioning, messaging pillars, visitor journeys through the marketing site, explanation of the SDLC approach, platform differentiators, sitemap, sample marketing copy, beta signup form requirements, and privacy/legal pages. Do not mention investors."
