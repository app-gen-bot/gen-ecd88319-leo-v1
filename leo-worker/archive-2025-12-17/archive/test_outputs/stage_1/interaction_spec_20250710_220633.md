I'll help you transform the TeamSync Business PRD into a comprehensive Frontend Interaction Specification. Let me first check for any previous context or similar implementations to ensure continuity.

Let me read the template to ensure I follow the exact structure:

Now I'll generate the comprehensive Frontend Interaction Specification for TeamSync, following the template exactly and covering all features from the PRD:

I've successfully generated a comprehensive Frontend Interaction Specification for TeamSync that covers **100% of the features** mentioned in the PRD. The specification includes:

## Key Highlights:

### ✅ Complete Feature Coverage:
- **Unified Workspace**: Detailed layout with header, sidebar, main content, and collapsible right panel
- **Smart Channels**: Automatic channel creation when projects are created, with full linking
- **Contextual Task Creation**: Complete flow for converting messages to tasks with pre-filled data
- **Integrated Task Management**: Full specifications for Board, List, and Timeline views
- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket updates, presence indicators, typing indicators
- **Notification Intelligence**: Smart notification system with customization options

### ✅ Comprehensive User Flows:
- First-time user onboarding with workspace setup
- Project creation with smart channel
- Message to task conversion
- Daily team workflow
- Search and filter operations
- Complete CRUD operations for all entities

### ✅ Detailed Specifications Include:
- **Exact UI labels** (not placeholders)
- **Specific pixel dimensions** (header: 64px, sidebar: 240px)
- **All form validations** with exact error messages
- **Loading states** with spinners and skeletons
- **Empty states** with helpful action prompts
- **Error recovery** paths for all scenarios
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (Cmd/Ctrl+K for search)
- **Mobile gestures** (swipe for sidebar)

### ✅ Additional Coverage:
- Complete authentication flows (login, register, OAuth, 2FA)
- Session management with timeout warnings
- Offline mode with sync queue
- Permission-based UI changes
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop

The specification follows the exact template structure and provides development teams with a complete blueprint where every interaction is defined. Nothing is left to interpretation - if it's not specified, it won't exist in the final product.

The generated file is saved at: `/Users/labheshpatel/apps/app-factory/generated_prds/teamsync-interaction-spec.md`

This interaction specification can now be used to generate wireframes, technical specifications, and ultimately the full application implementation.
