Today, we’re introducing a dedicated space to view artifacts in the Claude app, and the ability to embed AI capabilities directly into your creations—transforming artifacts into interactive, AI-powered apps.

Since launch, millions of users have created over half a billion artifacts—from productivity tools to educational games—and now you can create even more interactive experiences to use and share.

## Build AI-powered apps with Claude

Artifacts turn anyone into an app creator—no coding needed. Just tell Claude your idea to instantly create shareable apps, tools, and games.

With our latest update, you can build even more interactive experiences. For example, rather than asking Claude to create a set of flashcards for one topic, you can ask Claude to build a [flashcard app](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.1e8b05e4-4cce-45a4-a05c-6dbd48c8404f/public/artifacts/0e6f226e-70b0-418d-a03c-77ba65e4ba14) that lets users pick their own topic and generate their own cards. Instead of a single-use artifact, you now have an interactive app you can use and share more broadly.

Additionally, our new artifacts space makes creation seamless:

- **Browse curated artifacts** for inspiration
- **Customize existing creations** in minutes
- **Build from scratch **through simple conversation
- **Organize everything** in one place

## When conversation becomes creation

Music producer Rick Rubin captured this shift perfectly with “[The Way of Code](https://www.thewayofcode.com/),” exploring how conversation itself becomes a form of creative expression. His project paired 81 meditations with interactive artifacts that anyone can reshape with Claude.

## Getting started

Want to create a personalized storytelling app? A coding tutor that adjusts to different learning styles? A creative writing assistant? Just describe your idea to Claude.

Access the new artifacts space from the sidebar in the Claude app—it’s currently available to Free, Pro, and Max users. Whether you want to browse for inspiration, customize existing creations, or build something entirely new, the tools are at your fingertips.

You can also share artifacts for anyone to view your creations. To get the full experience, viewers can sign in to a Claude account with any plan.

The ability to embed AI capabilities directly into your artifacts is available in beta. Learn more about how to build and share AI-powered apps with Claude [here](claude-powered-artifacts).
