Today, we're announcing that Claude models are helping power Alexa+. This collaboration is part of our ongoing partnership with Amazon to deliver advanced AI technology to businesses and consumers around the world.

Teams from Amazon and Anthropic worked closely throughout the past year. Our Chief Product Officer, Mike Krieger, led a team that helped Alexa+ to get the full benefits of Claude's capabilities.

Consistent with Anthropic's commitment to trust and safety, Alexa+ is able to take advantage of our best in class safety capabilities, such as our advanced jailbreaking resistance.

Alexa+ accesses Claude through Amazon Bedrock. It will start rolling out in the U.S. in the next few weeks, becoming more widely available in the coming months.
