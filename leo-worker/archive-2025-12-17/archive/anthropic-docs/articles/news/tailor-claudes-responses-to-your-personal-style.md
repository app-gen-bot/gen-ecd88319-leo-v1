Today, we're announcing custom styles for all [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.1e8b05e4-4cce-45a4-a05c-6dbd48c8404f) users. Now you can tailor Claude's responses to your unique needs and workflows.

## Personalize Claude chats

With styles, you can customize Claude’s responses to match your communication preferences, tone, and structure. Whether you're a developer writing technical documentation, a marketer crafting specific brand guidelines, or a product team planning extensive project requirements, Claude can adapt to your preferred way of writing.

You can choose from the following: 

- **Formal**: clear and polished responses
- **Concise**: shorter and more direct responses
- **Explanatory**: educational responses for learning new concepts

## Generate custom styles

Beyond these preset options, Claude can generate **custom styles** for you. Upload sample content that reflects your preferred way of communicating, specify instructions to match your needs, and edit your preferences as they evolve.

Early customers like GitLab have leveraged styles to standardize communication and decision-making in their daily workflows across a variety of scenarios.

> Claude’s ability to maintain a consistent voice while adapting to different contexts allows our team members to use styles for various use cases including writing business cases, updating user documentation, and creating and translating marketing materials. The combination of pre-built styles for quick alignment and custom styles to match different user’s preferences make it a useful tool.

— Taylor McCaslin, product lead for AI and ML tech at GitLab
