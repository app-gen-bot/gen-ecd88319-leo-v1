Today, we’re launching Anthropic's AI for Science program – a new initiative designed to accelerate scientific research and discovery through access to our API. This program will provide free API credits to support researchers working on high-impact scientific projects, with a particular focus on biology and life sciences applications.

## Why AI for Science?

At Anthropic, we believe that AI has the potential to significantly accelerate scientific progress. Advanced AI reasoning and language capabilities can help researchers analyze complex scientific data, generate hypotheses, design experiments, and communicate findings more effectively. By reducing the time and resources needed for scientific discovery, we can help address some of humanity's most pressing challenges.

This initiative aligns with our vision of building AI systems that bring value to humanity, as discussed in our CEO Dario Amodei's [Machines of Loving Grace](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace). We're particularly interested in supporting applications where AI can assist in accelerating processes related to understanding complex biological systems, analyzing genetic data, accelerating drug discovery especially for some of the largest global disease burdens, increasing agricultural productivity, and more.

## Program Details

The AI for Science program will offer significant API credits to qualified researchers who will be selected based on their contributions to science, the potential impact of their proposed research, and AI’s ability to meaningfully accelerate their work.

## How to Apply

Researchers attached to a research institution interested in the AI for Science program can apply through our[ application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwDGfVg2lHJ0cc0oF_ilEnjvr_r4_paYi7VLlr5cLNXASdvA/viewform?usp=header). Applications will be reviewed by our team, including subject matter experts in relevant fields.

We look forward to seeing how researchers use our API to push the boundaries of scientific discovery and create positive impact in the world.
