[Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) is now available in Canada. Starting today, people and businesses across the country will be able to access Claude via:

- [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.1e8b05e4-4cce-45a4-a05c-6dbd48c8404f): the web-based version of our next-generation AI assistant.
- The [Claude iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/claude/id6473753684): the free mobile app available in the Apple App Store that offers the same intuitive experience as mobile web.
- The [Claude API](https://www.anthropic.com/api): an interface that allows developers to integrate Anthropic’s state-of-the-art AI models into their own applications, websites, or services.
- The [Claude Team plan](https://www.anthropic.com/news/team-plan-and-ios): a secure workspace for teams to collaborate that offers increased usage for members.

For CA$28 + tax per month, users can subscribe to [Claude Pro](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) and unlock access to all models (including [Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family)), 5x more usage than our free Claude.ai offering, and early access to new features. The Team plan is CA$42 + tax per user per month with a minimum of 5 seats.

We’re excited to expand our offerings to Canada—a country that has made significant contributions to the responsible development and deployment of AI—and look forward to seeing the different ways our users across Canada incorporate the Claude 3 model family into their workflows.
