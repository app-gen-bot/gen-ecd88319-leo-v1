Today, we’re introducing a paid plan for our [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.1e8b05e4-4cce-45a4-a05c-6dbd48c8404f) chat experience, currently available in the US and UK.Since launching in July, users tell us they’ve chosen Claude.ai as their day-to-day AI assistant for its longer context windows, faster outputs, complex reasoning capabilities, and more. Many also shared that they would value more file uploads and conversations over longer periods.With [Claude Pro](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.1e8b05e4-4cce-45a4-a05c-6dbd48c8404f/settings/billing?action=subscribe), subscribers can now gain **5x more usage** of our latest model, Claude 2, for a monthly price of $20 (US) or £18 (UK).This means you can level up your productivity across a range of tasks, including summarizing research papers, querying contracts, and iterating further on coding projects—like this recent [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVsHikXgK9Y) of building an interactive map.

Claude Pro offers:

- 5x more usage than our free tier provides, with the ability to send many more messages
- Priority access to Claude.ai during high-traffic periods
- Early access to new features that help you get the most out of Claude

You can learn more about these benefits, including how to maximize your usage, [here](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8324991-about-claude-pro-usage).We’re grateful for your support as we strive to build helpful, honest, and harmless systems that fuel productivity and inspire creativity.
