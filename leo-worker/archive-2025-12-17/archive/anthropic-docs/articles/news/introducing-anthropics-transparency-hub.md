Today, we're launching Anthropic's [Transparency Hub](https://www.anthropic.com/transparency)—a detailed overview of concrete measures we're implementing to ensure our systems are safe, beneficial, and trustworthy.

As AI capabilities advance rapidly, meaningful transparency is essential for building trust and accountability. Organizations working on frontier AI have a responsibility to provide clear insights into their processes for responsible scaling, safety protocols, and risk mitigation strategies—particularly as regulatory frameworks continue to evolve. As a starting point, we are publishing our first periodic report on several key transparency metrics: banned accounts, account appeals, appeal overturns, reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and government request data.

Our Transparency Hub offers detailed information on:

- Methodologies for model evaluation and safety testing
- Platform abuse detection and enforcement measures
- Internal governance and risk assessment policies
- Methods for assessing and addressing potential societal impacts
- Research initiatives advancing the field of AI safety
- Security and privacy safeguards implemented throughout development

**Beyond Basic Reporting**

We've designed our approach to address a key challenge in AI governance: the proliferation of diverse documentation requirements across multiple transparency initiatives and voluntary commitments. This hub represents a unified framework, aimed to address the spectrum of requirements. It allows users, policymakers, and stakeholders to have a clear view into our model development and deployment in a structured, accessible and accountable way.

**An Ongoing Commitment**

In keeping with our commitment to raising the bar on transparency, we'll continuously expand our reporting to reflect evolving best practices as AI capabilities advance and new challenges emerge.

We invite you to explore the [Transparency Hub](https://www.anthropic.com/transparency) and see firsthand how we're working to build AI systems worthy of trust. We welcome your feedback at transparency@anthropic.com.
