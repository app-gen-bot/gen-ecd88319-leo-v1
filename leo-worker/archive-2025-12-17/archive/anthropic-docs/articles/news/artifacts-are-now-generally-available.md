Today, we’re making **Artifacts** available for all [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.a7804c3a-c42c-48ad-9cbe-063c7206e867) users across our Free, Pro, and Team plans. And now, you can create and view Artifacts on our [iOS](https://anthropic.com/ios) and [Android](https://anthropic.com/android) apps.

Artifacts turn conversations with Claude into a more creative and collaborative experience. With Artifacts, you have a dedicated window to instantly see, iterate, and build on the work you create with Claude. Since launching as a [feature preview](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) in June, users have created tens of millions of Artifacts.
