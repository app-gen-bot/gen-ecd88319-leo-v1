We're excited to announce that Mike Krieger has joined Anthropic as our Chief Product Officer. Mike will oversee Anthropic's product engineering, product management, and product design efforts as we work to expand our suite of enterprise applications and bring Claude to a wider audience.

Mike brings deep experience building and scaling innovative products and user experiences, most notably as the co-founder and CTO of Instagram. During his tenure, he grew the engineering team to over 450 people and helped scale the platform to more than a billion users.

More recently, Mike spent the past three years building Artifact, a personalized news app, prior to its acquisition by Yahoo. With deep expertise across the product development lifecycle, from hands-on coding to product vision and leadership, Mike is uniquely suited to take Anthropic's product efforts to the next level as the company continues its rapid growth.

"I've long admired Anthropic's relentless focus on building capable and trustworthy AI systems that empower humans and expand what's possible with technology," said Mike. "I'm thrilled to join the exceptional team at Anthropic and partner with them to design and scale transformative products like Claude. The potential for AI to positively impact the world is immense, and I believe Anthropic has the talent, principles, and technology to help realize that potential."

"Mike is a world-class engineer, builder, and leader," said Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic. "Mike's background in developing intuitive products and user experiences will be invaluable as we create new ways for people to interact with Claude, particularly in the workplace. We feel fortunate to add Mike's vision and expertise to our leadership team.”
