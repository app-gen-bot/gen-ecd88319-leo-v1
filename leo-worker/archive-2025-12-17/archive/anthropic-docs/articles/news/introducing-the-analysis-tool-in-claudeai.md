We're introducing the analysis tool, a new built-in feature for [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.1e8b05e4-4cce-45a4-a05c-6dbd48c8404f) that enables Claude to write and run JavaScript code. Claude can now process data, conduct analysis, and produce real-time insights. The analysis tool is available for all Claude.ai users in [feature preview](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.1e8b05e4-4cce-45a4-a05c-6dbd48c8404f/new?fp=1).

Think of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. The ability to process information and run code means you get more accurate answers—building on [Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) state-of-the-art coding and data skills.

## Analyzing and visualizing data from CSV files

When you need precise, verifiable answers from data, Claude now works more like a real data analyst. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data—cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result.

While Claude could always write code, it can now run that code within Claude.ai to support all types of analysis tasks. With the analysis tool, you get answers that are not just well-reasoned, but are mathematically precise and reproducible.

The analysis tool in Claude.ai can expand capabilities across teams. For example:

- **Marketers** can upload customer interactions across the full funnel and Claude will surface opportunities to improve conversions.
- **Sales** **teams** can upload global sales data and Claude will provide country-specific performance analysis.
- **Product** **managers** can upload customer engagement data and Claude will help inform sprint planning and development priorities.
- **Engineers** can upload performance logs from various servers and Claude will identify areas for better resource utilization.
- **Finance** **teams** can upload monthly financial data and Claude will create a financial dashboard to convey key trends and inform decision making.
