We’re excited to announce that [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude), Anthropic’s trusted AI assistant, is now available for people and businesses across Europe to enhance their productivity and creativity. Starting today, they will be able to use:

- [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.1e8b05e4-4cce-45a4-a05c-6dbd48c8404f): the web-based version of our next-generation AI assistant
- The [Claude iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/claude/id6473753684): a free version of Claude that offers the same intuitive experience as mobile web
- The [Claude Team plan](https://www.anthropic.com/news/team-plan-and-ios): the best way for every business to provide teams with secure access to Claude's state-of-the-art AI capabilities and the [Claude 3 model family](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family)

Today’s release follows the Europe launch of the Claude API earlier this year, which allows developers to integrate Anthropic’s state-of-the-art AI models into their own applications, websites, or services.

Claude has strong levels of comprehension and fluency in French, German, Spanish, Italian, and other European languages, allowing users to converse with Claude in multiple languages. Claude’s intuitive, user-friendly interface makes it easy for anyone to seamlessly integrate our advanced AI models into their workflows.

Both Claude.ai and the Claude iOS app are available for free. The Claude app is available for download in the Apple App Store. For €18 + VAT per month (or local currency equivalent), users can subscribe to Claude Pro and unlock all models, including Claude 3 Opus, one of the most advanced models on the market. The Team plan is €28 + VAT per user per month (or local currency equivalent), with a minimum of 5 seats.

At Anthropic, we're dedicated to creating AI systems that put people first. We look forward to bringing the unique capabilities of the Claude 3 model family to more people throughout Europe.
