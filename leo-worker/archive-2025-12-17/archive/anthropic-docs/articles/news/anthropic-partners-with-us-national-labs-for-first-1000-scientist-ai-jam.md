We are proud to participate in the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) first-ever 1,000 Scientist AI Jam, which will bring together scientists across multiple National Laboratories to evaluate frontier AI models on scientific research and national security applications. AI has the potential to dramatically accelerate scientific discovery and technological development, [compressing decades ](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace)of scientific progress into just a few years by enabling a new era of invention and problem-solving that addresses humanity’s greatest challenges. This week, we [launched](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet) Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the first hybrid reasoning model on the market, which will be evaluated at the event.

## Accelerating American scientific leadership through AI

The AI Jam session represents a significant milestone in the partnership between frontier AI companies and DOE National Laboratories. Scientists from multiple laboratories will explore Claude’s capabilities across a range of scientific tasks—from problem understanding and literature search to hypothesis generation, experiment planning, code generation, and result analysis.

These scientists will test Claude’s abilities using real-world research problems from their respective domains. This testing offers a more authentic assessment of AI’s potential to manage the complexities and nuances of scientific inquiry, as well as evaluate AI’s ability to solve complex scientific challenges that typically require significant time and resources.

## Building on established partnerships

This initiative builds on Anthropic’s existing partnership with the Department of Energy, including the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). In April 2024, Anthropic [became the first frontier lab](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/14/anthropic-claude-nuclear-information-safety) to collaborate with NNSA and DOE National Laboratories to evaluate a model in a Top Secret classified environment to determine how large language models may contribute to or help to address national security risks in the nuclear domain.

The AI Jam session expands this work beyond security testing to explore how AI can contribute to solving our nation's most pressing scientific challenges. This event offers a rare opportunity to get feedback on our models across a wide range of realistic scientific tasks. The insights gained will help us improve Claude to better serve America’s scientific community and further strengthen our nation's competitive advantage.

## AI for scientific progress

Through initiatives like the AI Jam session, we are demonstrating how industry and government can work together to harness AI’s transformative potential while addressing potential risks through rigorous testing. Applying our most advanced technology to the nation’s critical scientific challenges will help contribute to a vision where AI becomes a powerful force for progress.
