We’re excited to announce that Krishna Rao has joined Anthropic as our Chief Financial Officer. With nearly 20 years of experience as a strategic finance leader for customer-centric, world-class brands and as an investor, Krishna will play a crucial role in shaping Anthropic's financial strategy and operations as we continue to build on our strong enterprise momentum and advance our international expansion.

Krishna joins us from Fanatics Commerce, where he served as CFO, bringing with him a wealth of experience from his previous roles. At Cedar, a healthcare payments and patient engagement platform, Krishna led both the finance function and operational initiatives as the company’s CFO.

Earlier in his career, Krishna spent time as a private equity investor at Blackstone and as a strategy consultant at Bain & Company. With a J.D. from Yale Law School and an A.B. in economics from Harvard College, Krishna brings a unique blend of financial acumen, strategic thinking, and operational expertise to Anthropic.
