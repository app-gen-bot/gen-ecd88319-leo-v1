Lyft is working with Anthropic to introduce customer-first, AI-powered Lyft products. This is to enhance the rideshare experience for its community of more than 40 million annual riders and over 1 million drivers. The work includes early research testing of new models and technology, alongside initiatives to advance Lyft's engineering capabilities.

The impact is already evident. Lyft's customer care AI assistant, powered by Claude via Amazon Bedrock, has reduced customer service resolution time by 87%, handling thousands of daily customer inquiries while seamlessly transitioning complex cases to human specialists when needed.

The collaboration focuses on three key areas:

- **AI-Powered Solutions: **Lyft and Anthropic will architect and deploy AI applications that enhance the rideshare experience for both riders and drivers.
- **Early Testing: **Lyft will participate in research testing for new products and capabilities to ensure they align with the needs of riders and drivers, enabling faster integration of proven solutions.
- **Engineering Advancement: **Anthropic will provide specialized training to strengthen Lyft's engineering teams, accelerating their ability to build innovative AI-powered features.

> Software engineering has undergone a seismic shift with the introduction of GenAI technologies. Gone are the days when humans were predominantly writing code. With the promise of LLMs, especially leading models for coding like Claude, and agentic AI, we're working to revolutionize our engineering organization to more effectively build game changing products for our customers.

— Jason Vogrinec, Executive Vice President, Platforms at Lyft

For the millions of people who rely on Lyft every day, this collaboration aims to make every interaction more efficient and personal. When engaging with Claude-powered features, users will experience the same thoughtful, human-centered approach that defines both companies' commitment to customer service.

> Lyft is using Claude to both reimagine the future of ridesharing, and at the same time deliver tangible benefits to their community today," said Michael Gerstenhaber, Vice President of Product Management at Anthropic. "This approach, combined with their deep collaboration with our team of experts, creates a blueprint for how companies can successfully bring AI into their business.
