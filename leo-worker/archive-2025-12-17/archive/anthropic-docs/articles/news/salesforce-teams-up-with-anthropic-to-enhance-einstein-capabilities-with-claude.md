Salesforce customers can now select [Claude models](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) for AI-powered Salesforce applications and experiences built with the Salesforce Platform. The latest Claude models—Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, and Claude 3 Haiku—are now available to Salesforce customers using Amazon Bedrock.

Now, Claude can help Salesforce enterprises improve efficiency, insight, and personalization across their entire operation, including sales, customer service, marketing, commerce, and IT, among others.

Claude is designed for enterprise-grade security and accuracy, with industry-leading skills that lead to near-human voice and tone and less hallucination than other LLMs. Salesforce customers can now select Claude models in prompt templates that power custom AI experiences or, most recently, custom actions for [Agentforce Agents](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/), which can plan and take action on behalf of employees and customers.

> Through our partnership with Anthropic, customers gain the flexibility to integrate their own LLMs, introducing Claude models with diverse levels of intelligence, speed, and cost-effectiveness. This empowers users to tailor their CRM applications to their unique requirements.

*– Kaushal Kurapati, Senior Vice President of Product for AI at Salesforce*
