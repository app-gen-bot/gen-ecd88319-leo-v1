Claude, Anthropic’s trusted AI assistant, is now available in Brazil. Starting today, consumers and businesses in Brazil will be able to access Claude via:

- [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.a7804c3a-c42c-48ad-9cbe-063c7206e867): The web-based version of our next-generation AI assistant.
- Claude mobile apps: Free [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anthropic.claude&pli=1) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/claude/id6473753684) apps, offering an intuitive mobile experience and access to our most powerful model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
- [Anthropic API](https://www.anthropic.com/api): Enables developers to integrate Anthropic's state-of-the-art AI models into their own applications, websites, or services.

Claude.ai offers both free and paid plans. Paid users on the [Pro plan](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) get 5x more usage versus our Free tier, early access to new features, and access to all our current Claude models—including [Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet), our most intelligent model yet, and the rest of the Claude 3 family—for R$ 110 per user per month.

Paid users on the [Team plan](https://www.anthropic.com/team) get even more usage and access to shared chats with teammates for R$ 165 per user per month, with a minimum of 5 seats. The Team plan includes administrative tools to conveniently control user and billing management for easier onboarding and less overhead.

## Commitment to safety and privacy

Anthropic prioritizes safety, privacy, and ethical AI development in Claude's design. Rigorous testing and training aim to reduce misuse, while a strong commitment to user privacy means generative models are not trained on user data without explicit permission.
