Today, we're announcing that Jay Kreps, co-founder and CEO of Confluent, has joined Anthropic's Board of Directors. Jay's extensive experience in building and scaling highly successful tech companies will play an important role as Anthropic prepares for the next phase of growth. His deep expertise in data infrastructure and open-source software development will be particularly valuable as we build data-driven product experiences for our growing base of enterprise customers.

"Anthropic is at an exciting inflection point," said Jay. "In a remarkably short period, the team has developed one of the most advanced large language models on the market, contributed groundbreaking safety research to the field, and attracted top talent in the industry. Anthropic's human-centered approach deeply resonates with my values, and I look forward to working with the leadership team and the Long-Term Benefit Trust as they work to expand the business, develop AI systems that enterprises can trust, and raise the bar for responsible deployment practices."

Jay was appointed to the board by Anthropic's Long-Term Benefit Trust. As a member of the Board, Jay will work closely with its existing members Yasmin Razavi from Spark Capital, Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, and Daniela Amodei, co-founder and President of Anthropic. Separately, Luke Muehlhauser has decided to step down from his Board role to focus on his work at Open Philanthropy.

Daniela Amodei, co-founder and President of Anthropic, said, "As a seasoned founder, Jay brings a wealth of expertise in building and scaling highly technical businesses, serving customers, and leading fast-growing teams. His track record, coupled with his commitment to ensuring AI is developed and deployed responsibly make him an invaluable asset to our Board. At the same time, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Luke for his contributions to Anthropic. His guidance and thoughtfulness helped the company navigate our first phase of growth in line with our public benefit mission, and we wish him the very best."

Neil Buddy Shah, Chair of Anthropic's Long-Term Benefit Trust and CEO of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, said, "Jay is an outstanding addition to the board, and I am confident that his expertise and leadership will guide Anthropic through the scale that is to come, while upholding the company’s deep and founding commitment to building safe and trustworthy AI systems."
