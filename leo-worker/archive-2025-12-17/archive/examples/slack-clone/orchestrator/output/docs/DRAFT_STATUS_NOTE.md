# Draft Status Note

## Current Specification Status

The following specifications in this directory are **DRAFT** versions that were generated before the wireframe:

- `02_api_contract.md` - DRAFT
- `04_frontend_spec.md` - DRAFT  
- `05_backend_spec.md` - DRAFT

These will be **regenerated** after the wireframe is approved by the user.

## Why Draft?

Following the "prompt to URL" philosophy, we've learned that:
1. The wireframe should drive API design, not vice versa
2. User interactions in the wireframe determine what endpoints are needed
3. Premature API specification leads to wasted effort

## What Remains Valid?

- `01_business_spec.md` - This drives the wireframe creation
- `03_data_models.md` - Core entities remain stable (though may need minor updates)

## Next Steps

1. Create wireframe from Business Spec
2. Get user approval on wireframe
3. Regenerate API Contract based on actual wireframe interactions
4. Update Frontend/Backend specs to match approved wireframe
5. Proceed with implementation

This approach ensures specifications match what was actually approved by the user.
