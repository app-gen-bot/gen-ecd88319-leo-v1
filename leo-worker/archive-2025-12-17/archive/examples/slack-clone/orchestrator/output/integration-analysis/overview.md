Key Insight from Workflow

The original workflow (from CLAUDE.md) shows we're in Phase 2: Specification:
Phase 1: Visual ✓ (Wireframe complete)
Phase 2: Specification (current)

- Wireframe → API Contract
- Generate final specs

Phase 3: Implementation

- Build to specifications

These delta documents provide the critical analysis needed to update the DRAFT specifications into final, accurate
specifications based on what was actually built in the wireframe.
