# Happy Llama Website - Business Requirements Document

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

Happy Llama Website is a high-impact marketing and credibility platform designed to showcase the revolutionary multi-agent AI AppFactory that transforms ideas into production-ready applications. The website serves as the primary digital touchpoint for three distinct audiences: citizen developers seeking to build their first app, enterprises evaluating AI-powered development platforms, and investors assessing the company's potential. The platform emphasizes the unique value proposition of delivering enterprise-grade rigor and reliability to every user, regardless of technical expertise.

The website's core mission is to drive beta signups while establishing Happy Llama as the definitive solution for democratized, AI-powered software development. By highlighting the platform's learning capabilities, hierarchical memory system, and unwavering commitment to type-safety and explainability, the website positions Happy Llama as the bridge between rapid prototyping and production-grade software development.

Success will be measured through qualified beta submissions, investor meeting requests, and deep engagement with technical content that validates the platform's enterprise readiness. The website must convey both accessibility for non-technical users and the sophisticated engineering principles that make Happy Llama suitable for mission-critical applications.
