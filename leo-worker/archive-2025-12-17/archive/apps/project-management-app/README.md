### Quick Start

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/project-management-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🎯 Features to Test

### 1. Navigation
- Click on different projects in the sidebar
- Switch between workspaces (dropdown in header)

- Mark tasks as complete with checkbox

### 4. Filtering
- Use the filter dropdowns to filter by:
  - Assignee
  - Status

- Search for tasks using the search bar

### 5. Responsive Design
- Resize your browser to see mobile/tablet layouts
- On mobile, the sidebar becomes a drawer
- Touch-friendly interface on smaller screens

```

## 🎨 Customization

### Theme
- The app supports light/dark mode
- Toggle using the theme button in the header
- Colors can be customized in `tailwind.config.ts`

### Mock Data
- The app currently uses mock data
- Real API integration would connect to the backend (Stage 4)
- Mock data is generated in the Zustand store

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is already in use:
```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Dependencies Issues
Clear cache and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Build Errors
Check for TypeScript errors:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to FastAPI backend (when Stage 4 is complete)
2. **Authentication**: Add login/signup flows
3. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections
4. **Data Persistence**: Connect to DynamoDB
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to AWS using CDK (Stage 5)

## 📝 Notes

This is a wireframe/prototype generated by the AI App Factory. It includes:
- Full UI implementation
- State management structure
- Mock data for testing
- All core features ready for backend integration

The app is fully functional as a frontend prototype and ready for backend integration!
