I'll analyze the Stage 2 Wireframe Generation execution for the AI Lawyer application. Let me start by checking for previous context and then gather the necessary information.

Let me proceed to gather the execution data by reading the QC report and checking the integration analysis.

Let me read the actual integration analysis report file:

Now let me use the integration analyzer tool to discover what files were added/modified:

Let me check what files exist in the frontend directory:

Now let me check the existing QC analysis report from the parent directory:

Let me look for any QC reports in the current directory:

Let me read the actual QC analysis report for the AI Lawyer app:

Let me also check for any critic analysis reports:

Let me read the critic analysis from iteration 2:

Let me also check for form validation report to understand additional quality aspects:

Now I have enough information to generate a comprehensive retrospective report for the Stage 2 Wireframe Generation execution. Let me compile this analysis.

I've completed a comprehensive retrospective analysis of the Stage 2 Wireframe Generation execution for the AI Lawyer application. The report has been saved to `/Users/labheshpatel/apps/app-factory/apps/ai-lawyer/specs/stage_2_retrospective_report.md`.

## Key Findings Summary:

### **Executive Summary**
The execution achieved 92% specification compliance with exceptional code quality, but at a high cost of $75.81 for 2 iterations. All 8 MVP features were implemented successfully, though some process gaps were identified.

### **Critical Issues Found**
1. **API Implementation Mismatch** - Real HTTP client instead of mock implementations
2. **Missing Public Pages** - 4 pages referenced in navigation but not created
3. **High Execution Cost** - $75.81 suggests optimization opportunities

### **Success Patterns Identified**
- 100% MVP feature implementation
- Zero syntax/TypeScript errors
- Exceptional UX with loading states and error handling
- Clean, maintainable code architecture

### **Key Recommendations**
1. **Clarify Mock API Requirements** - Explicitly specify "setTimeout with fake data"
2. **Add Navigation Checklist** - Ensure all linked pages are created
3. **Optimize Agent Prompting** - Reduce iteration costs by 30-40%
4. **Provide Pattern Templates** - For common implementations like form validation

The report provides actionable insights for improving future Stage 2 executions, focusing on specification clarity, cost optimization, and comprehensive scope management. Despite the high cost, the quality of output was exceptional, demonstrating the agent's capability when properly guided.
