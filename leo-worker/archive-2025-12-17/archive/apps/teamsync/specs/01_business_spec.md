I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD for an application that combines the best features of Slack and Asana. Let me first check for any previous context about similar applications.

I'll proceed with creating the PRD. Before I generate the complete document, let me ask a few essential clarifying questions to ensure I capture your vision correctly:

1. **Primary Use Case**: Are you envisioning this for small teams (5-20 people), medium organizations (20-100), or enterprise scale? This will help me understand the complexity of features needed.

2. **Core Focus**: Which aspect is more critical for your users - the real-time communication (Slack-like) or the project/task management (Asana-like)? Or truly equal emphasis on both?

3. **Key Differentiator**: What specific pain point are you solving that neither Slack nor Asana addresses well individually? For example:
   - Context switching between chat and tasks?
   - Turning conversations directly into actionable items?
   - Better visibility of project discussions?

4. **Industry/Domain**: Is this for general business use, or targeted at specific industries (tech, creative agencies, consulting, etc.)?

These answers will help me tailor the PRD to your specific vision while I make smart assumptions about standard features like authentication, notifications, and basic functionality.
