I'll analyze the Stage 2 Wireframe Generation v2 execution for the "app_20250714_021804" application. Let me start by gathering information from the available sources.

Now let me search for any existing knowledge about Stage 2 executions and gather the QC report.

Let me proceed to read the QC report and analyze the implementation.

Now let me read the integration analysis report to understand the implementation details better.

Now let me use the integration analyzer tool to discover what files were actually created.

Let me check what files exist in the frontend directory.

Let me get the total count of files and components to understand the scope better.

That's a lot of files - let me exclude node_modules.

Let me also check for build errors and test results.

Now let me check if there are any execution logs or build outputs.

Now let me store this knowledge for future reference.

Let me summarize the session and create the retrospective report.

Now I'll create the comprehensive retrospective report based on my analysis.

I've completed a comprehensive retrospective analysis of the Stage 2 Wireframe Generation v2 execution for app_20250714_021804. Here's a summary of my findings:

## Key Findings:

**✅ Successes:**
- 92% compliance rate with interaction specifications
- Successfully generated 108 TypeScript files with proper Next.js 14 structure
- All 29 routes implemented correctly
- Build completed successfully with production-ready output
- Added valuable extra features (dedicated completion routes, QR code component)
- Cost-effective at $60.58 for the scope delivered

**❌ Issues Identified:**
- **Critical**: Missing task response system (Accept/Negotiate/Question flow)
- **High**: No real backend integration (mock data only)
- **High**: No real-time features or WebSocket implementation
- **Medium**: Incomplete message filtering and mobile swipe gestures
- **Low**: Partial family invitation flow

## Root Causes:
1. **Specification Interpretation (20%)**: Complex interactions overlooked in favor of basic CRUD
2. **Technical Limitations (30%)**: Mock data coupling and missing real-time architecture
3. **Time/Resource Management (25%)**: Features prioritized by quantity over interaction quality
4. **Tool Usage Patterns (25%)**: Over-reliance on code generation without runtime validation

## Key Recommendations:
1. Add explicit interaction checklists to prompts
2. Implement browser-based validation during execution
3. Create API abstraction layer for easier backend integration
4. Add interaction flow planning before implementation
5. Implement feature-by-feature validation loops

The analysis reveals that while the agent excels at structural implementation and following technical patterns, it struggles with complex interaction patterns and runtime validation. The missing task response system is particularly critical as it's core to the "LoveyTasks" concept of transforming chores into messages of love.

The retrospective report has been saved to `/Users/labheshpatel/apps/app-factory/apps/app_20250714_021804/specs/stage2-retrospective-report.md` for future reference and process improvement.
