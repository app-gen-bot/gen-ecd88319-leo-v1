I'll help you transform a Business PRD into a comprehensive Frontend Interaction Specification. However, I notice that the Business PRD content is missing from your request. 

First, let me check for any previous context:

I notice that the Business PRD content is missing from your request. To create a comprehensive Frontend Interaction Specification, I need the actual PRD document that you want me to transform.

Please provide the Business PRD content that should appear after the "## Business PRD to Transform:" section. The PRD should include:

- **Product Overview**: What the application does
- **Target Users**: Who will use it
- **Core Features**: Main functionality to be implemented
- **Business Rules**: Any constraints or requirements
- **User Stories**: What users need to accomplish
- **Success Metrics**: How success is measured

Once you provide the PRD, I'll create a detailed interaction specification that:
1. Covers 100% of the features mentioned
2. Follows the exact template structure from `docs/ai-app-factory/templates/interaction-spec.md`
3. Defines every user interaction with specific labels and behaviors
4. Includes complete user flows and navigation mapping
5. Specifies all UI states (empty, loading, error, success)
6. Ensures nothing is left undefined for the development team

Please paste the Business PRD content, and I'll transform it into a comprehensive interaction specification.
