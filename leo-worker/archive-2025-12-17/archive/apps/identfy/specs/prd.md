Identity Verification Customer Portal for Identfy: Key Features and Design Considerations
Name of the company: Identfy
Overview
A customer portal for identity verification is an administrative platform where business clients (e.g. Airbnb using Jumio) configure and manage their identity verification process for end-users. This portal is not where the end-users get verified, but rather a “mission control” for the business to tailor workflows, set rules, and monitor verification outcomes

. The goal is to empower the client with full control over their onboarding and fraud prevention logic, without needing to write code. In such a portal, an authorized employee of the client can create verification workflows, choose which checks to include, define automated decision criteria, and oversee results in real time. It provides transparency into how many verifications are happening, what the risk levels are, and helps the client fine-tune their Know Your Customer (KYC) and fraud prevention strategies. Below, we outline the key features and best practices for designing this customer portal.
Workflow Configuration and Orchestration
One of the core features is a no-code workflow builder that allows clients to create and modify verification workflows visually. Using a drag-and-drop interface, risk and compliance teams can define the sequence of checks a user will go through, along with any branching logic or rules. This orchestration layer should be very flexible: for example, administrators could start with a library of pre-built rules and then customize them to fit their business needs
jumio.com
. Leading identity platforms offer hundreds of pre-configured rules (e.g. velocity checks, geolocation rules, spend pattern flags) to choose from
beverified.org
. The workflow builder should support “if-then” conditional logic, weighted scoring, and even A/B testing of different flows
beverified.org
. This means the client can set up rules like “If device reputation is poor and document verification fails, assign a high risk score and route to manual review” or test two different onboarding flows to see which yields lower fraud. The interface must make it easy to adjust these workflows on the fly (low-code/no-code) so that businesses can respond to emerging fraud trends or changing compliance rules without engineering effort

.
Selection of Verification Signals: The workflow builder should present a buffet of verification services (signals) that the client can include as steps in their workflow. For each type of check, the client can toggle it on/off or configure its provider. Key verification signals to support include:
Document & Biometric Verification: Capture a government-issued ID and a selfie from the user, and use AI to match the photo and assess liveness
beverified.org
. This confirms the person’s identity by comparing their selfie to the ID photo and ensures they are physically present (not a deepfake or mask).
Phone Number Verification: Confirm the user’s phone by sending a one-time passcode or querying telecom data, and evaluate phone-based risk signals (e.g. whether the number is VOIP or recently activated)
beverified.org
. This helps ensure the phone is valid and can be tied to the user.
Email and IP Address Risk Checks: Analyze the user’s email and IP for fraud indicators (such as disposable email domains, known fraudulent IP ranges, geo-location mismatches, etc.)
beverified.org
. These signals can flag potentially risky users early (for example, if an email has no history or an IP is a proxy/VPN).
Device Fingerprinting: Generate a device fingerprint or device reputation score to detect emulator usage, rooted devices, or device anomalies. Device intelligence (e.g. recognizing if the same device was seen in previous fraud cases) can significantly enhance risk assessment
beverified.org
.
Watchlist Screening (PEPs/Sanctions): Check the user’s identity data against politically exposed persons (PEP) lists, sanctions databases, and other watchlists to ensure compliance with AML regulations
beverified.org
. If a user is a match or high-risk (e.g. on an OFAC sanctions list), the workflow might immediately flag or reject them.
Additional Signals: Depending on the platform’s capabilities, clients might also leverage address verification (cross-checking provided address against trusted databases), bank account or payment card checks, facial recognition against known fraudster databases, or other third-party data sources. For instance, one platform’s verification suite includes data sources like sanctions/watchlists, ongoing monitoring, identity record checks, phone and email risk, IP reputation, and even “known faces” recognition
helpnetsecurity.com
. The portal should be extensible to incorporate such signals as needed.
Each of these checks can be turned on or off in a workflow. Importantly, the portal could allow integration of different vendors for certain checks. For example, a business might choose between multiple phone verification providers or different watchlist data sources. By offering a modular approach, the portal lets customers pick the best sources for their use case or even use a primary and fallback vendor. This flexibility ensures the “one-stop” orchestration layer covers all the client’s needs without them having to juggle multiple vendor integrations
helpnetsecurity.com
.
Dynamic Workflow Rules: The portal should enable dynamic decisioning within a workflow. For example, a company could create a rule that high-risk signals trigger extra steps: if a user’s device or IP is high-risk, the workflow could automatically add a step for additional document verification or a live video call. Conversely, low-risk users might be fast-tracked with fewer checks to reduce friction. Jumio’s platform, for instance, emphasizes “creating friction only for higher-risk individuals” by triggering the right checks at the right time
jumio.com
. The rules engine should support setting threshold conditions (e.g. “if overall risk score > 80, require manual review”) and combining multiple conditions logically. A self-service rules editor is valuable so that risk teams can tweak thresholds or logic as fraud patterns evolve
jumio.com
.
Single vs. Multiple Workflows: In the initial iteration, it might be simplest to have one primary workflow per customer (all end-users go through the same verification flow). However, it’s wise to design with future expansion in mind. The portal could allow saving multiple workflow configurations and letting the client switch which one is active, or use different workflows for different user segments. In fact, advanced platforms already let organizations build multiple verification flows optimized for different markets or risk profiles
helpnetsecurity.com
. For example, a fintech might have a “standard KYC flow” and a “high-risk flow” for certain regions or transaction sizes. Even if only one can run at a time, being able to save and load workflows (or quickly adjust them) is useful. This also opens the door for A/B testing — trying two approaches and comparing outcomes — which as noted, some orchestration tools support in real time
beverified.org
.
AI-Powered Risk Scoring and Decision Automation
A critical component of the portal is an AI-driven risk scoring engine that aggregates the results of all signals into a single risk metric. The system should calculate a unified risk score (e.g. 0 to 100) for each verification or each user, giving a quick sense of how risky a given identity verification is
jumio.com
. For example, if a user’s device, IP, and phone all appear trustworthy and their ID document passes checks, they might get a low risk score (closer to 0, meaning low risk). If several signals raise red flags (email is disposable, device is on a blacklist, ID document looks forged), the score would be high (closer to 100, high risk). Jumio’s platform explicitly “calculates a single configurable risk score from multiple risk signals” and allows clients to use that score in workflows to drive decisions
jumio.com
. Having this configurable risk score means the client can set up automated decision rules based on score thresholds. For instance, the portal could let the customer define: “If risk score < 30, auto-approve the user. If 30–70, send to manual review. If > 70, auto-reject or ask for additional verification.” These cutoff values should be adjustable. The portal executes these decisions in real-time as verifications come in, so low-risk users get instant approval and high-risk ones are flagged without manual intervention. This kind of risk-based orchestration is a best practice to minimize friction for good users while catching fraud
jumio.com
. Equally important, the portal should allow the customer to tweak how the risk score is calculated or override it with custom logic. While an AI engine can weigh hundreds of signals, business clients may have unique risk appetite or domain knowledge. Thus, the platform might offer a rules-based scoring option or the ability to adjust weights. In the rules editor, an admin could specify that certain conditions add to the risk score (e.g. email domain is free email -> +10 points) or even create a custom score formula. In practice, many orchestration systems combine both approaches: an AI-generated score supplemented by user-defined rules
beverified.org
. The portal should make it transparent how the score is composed (which signals contributed to a high score), so the client trusts the automation and can explain decisions if needed. Ultimately, this combination of AI and custom scoring gives businesses confidence that they can both leverage advanced machine learning and maintain control over critical risk decisions
beverified.org
. To summarize, risk scoring and automation in the portal allows instant decisions based on defined risk thresholds, reducing the need for manual checks on obvious low-risk or high-risk cases. It streamlines the onboarding funnel while still catching fraud, and it ensures the **“right services are triggered at the right time based on the risk of each customer”*
jumio.com
. This intelligent automation is at the heart of modern identity verification programs.
Case Management and Manual Review Tools
Even with automated decisioning, there will be cases that require human investigation – for example, users flagged as high risk or verifications that landed in a manual review queue. The customer portal should include a robust case management system to handle these scenarios. In this section of the portal, compliance or fraud agents at the client company can review detailed information about a particular verification attempt and record their decisions. Key capabilities for case management include:
Detailed Case View: For each verification (or user identity) flagged for review, the portal should present all relevant data in one consolidated view. This acts as a “single source of truth” for investigators
withpersona.com
. For example, the reviewer should see the user’s submitted ID images, the selfie video or photos, the results of each verification signal (e.g. device assessment, IP geolocation, any database checks), and the computed risk score with an explanation of which factors made it high. Having everything in one place allows the reviewer to quickly understand why a case was flagged.
Collaboration and Annotations: The case management interface should allow reviewers to add notes and comments to document their findings or decisions. If multiple team members work on fraud reviews, they might need to tag a colleague or leave instructions. Features like commenting, tagging, or attaching files can facilitate this. Persona’s case management solution, for instance, emphasizes “robust collaboration and communication features that make teamwork easy” when investigating cases
withpersona.com
. The portal could also support assigning cases to specific reviewers or groups. For example, a high-risk case could be assigned to a senior fraud analyst. The ability to set statuses (e.g. Under Review, Approved, Rejected, Escalated) and maybe checklists for steps to complete can help standardize the review process
withpersona.com
.
Escalation and Multi-Level Reviews: In some organizations, certain cases might require multi-level approval (for instance, a frontline analyst reviews and then a manager approves the final decision for very high-risk cases). The system should support escalation queues and assignment policies – e.g. automatically routing a case to a “Level 2” queue if it meets certain criteria
withpersona.com
. This ensures that the right people review the right cases. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and alerts could be built in as well (for example, highlighting if a case has been waiting too long)
withpersona.com
.
Audit Logging and Compliance: Since manual review often deals with sensitive personal data and important decisions, the portal must log all actions for compliance and audit purposes. This means tracking who viewed or edited a case, what decisions were made and when, and any changes to data. A good case management tool will keep a comprehensive audit trail of the review process
withpersona.com
withpersona.com
. It may also include features like masking or role-based access control for personal data, so that reviewers only see the data they need (helping comply with privacy principles)
withpersona.com
. These controls are important for meeting regulations (like GDPR’s requirement for the ability to have human review and contest automated decisions
jumio.com
jumio.com
). In practice, this means the portal gives the end-user (through the client) a path for a human to re-check a decision if the user disputes it – case management is where that re-check would happen, with the reviewer overriding an automated outcome if appropriate.
Integration with External Systems: It can be useful if the case management can integrate or export data to other tools the business uses (for example, a CRM or a support ticket system). While not mandatory, some portals provide integrations (or at least the ability to export cases) to systems like Salesforce, Zendesk, etc., so that the verification review can be part of the business’s broader customer support or fraud operations workflow
withpersona.com
. At minimum, the portal should allow exporting or downloading case details (with all evidence) for record-keeping or regulatory reporting (e.g. filing a Suspicious Activity Report if needed in AML contexts).
In essence, the case management feature ensures that when the automated system flags a user, the client’s team has the tools to efficiently investigate and resolve it. They can trust the portal as the system of record for identity verification decisions, with all data at their fingertips and collaboration features to manage the workflow. A well-designed case management system not only helps catch fraud that the AI can’t be 100% sure about, but also provides transparency (so the client can justify why someone was rejected, aiding in dispute resolution and compliance).
Analytics and Reporting Dashboard
To help clients understand their identity verification performance and make informed adjustments, the portal should include comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities. Visual dashboards on the portal’s home screen can provide at-a-glance insights into key metrics and trends
jumio.com
. For example, a dashboard might show the total number of verification attempts over the past month, the approval rate vs. rejection rate, and how many verifications were flagged for manual review. Graphs can illustrate trends such as a spike in volume at certain times of day or an increase in failure rates from certain regions. Important metrics and reports to include:
Verification Volume and Outcomes: The portal should display how many verifications have been processed in a given period, and break down the outcomes (e.g. X% approved automatically, Y% sent to manual review, Z% failed/denied). This could be presented as conversion funnels or pie charts of outcome distribution. It helps the client gauge the efficiency of their onboarding – e.g. a high manual review rate might indicate stricter rules or possibly fraud attacks, whereas a very high auto-approve rate might indicate a smooth funnel or potentially too lax settings. Trends over time in these metrics are useful; for instance, seeing verifications per day in a line chart can reveal seasonal patterns or sudden spikes
jumio.com
.
Risk Profile Insights: Analytics should cover the risk scores and fraud signals being seen. For example, a chart could show the distribution of risk scores among all recent signups (how many users scored as high risk vs. low risk). Another useful view is the top reasons for failure or flags – e.g. “30% of rejected verifications were due to document fraud, 20% due to watchlist hits, 15% due to device risk, etc.” Identifying the most common fraud factors can help the client strengthen those areas. The dashboard might also highlight fraud patterns, such as an unusual cluster of high-risk signups from a particular geography or a repeat usage of the same ID document in multiple attempts. Since the platform aggregates a lot of data, it can use analytics to automatically surface anomalies (e.g. “Fraud Pattern Alert: 5 users with the same IP address failed verification this week”).
Cohort and Segment Analysis: For deeper analysis, the portal should allow clients to slice and dice the data by various dimensions. Cohort analysis could let them group verifications by signup date or campaign – for example, comparing the verification success rate of users who joined last week vs. last month. Similarly, filtering by region, device type, or other attributes can uncover differences (maybe users from a certain country have higher failure rates, suggesting documents from that country are harder to verify or more fraud-prone). Providing interactive filters or the ability to generate custom reports by segment will enable risk teams to pinpoint where problems or opportunities lie. These cohort-level analytics help in understanding user behavior over time and the effectiveness of fraud rules for different groups.
Benchmarking: It can be very insightful to provide benchmarks either against the company’s own historical performance or anonymous industry aggregates. For instance, the portal could show “Your approval rate this month is 85%, up from 80% last quarter” or “Your document fraud catch rate is in the top 20% compared to peers in the e-commerce sector.” While maintaining privacy, the provider (like Jumio) has a broad view of verification data across clients, so they could offer anonymized benchmarking stats. Even simple benchmarks like average verification time, average risk score, or typical pass rates in the client’s industry add context to the raw numbers. This helps the customer understand if their fraud levels are unusually high or if their user experience is lagging behind common standards. Benchmarking is an “interesting” value-add that gives clients a sense of where they stand and can spur them to improve settings if needed (e.g. if their manual review rate is much higher than industry norm, they might revisit their thresholds).
Usage and Operational Metrics: The dashboard might also incorporate metrics around processing times (e.g. average verification completion time), and operational efficiency (how many cases did reviewers handle, average time to resolve a case, etc.). Some platforms provide drill-down analytics where you can click on a statistic to see more details – for example, clicking on “manual review queue” could show a list of pending cases and their ages, or clicking on “fraud signals triggered” could show the breakdown of signal types triggered in those cases
beverified.org
. Drill-down capabilities turn the dashboard into a tool not just for static reporting but for actively investigating and understanding specific issues.
In addition to on-screen dashboards, the portal should support generating detailed reports that can be exported (CSV, PDF, etc.) for offline analysis or presentations. Clients may want monthly summary reports or the ability to schedule regular reports to be emailed to them. These reports could include raw data of all transactions as well as aggregated stats. As noted, user-friendly reporting and the ability to “run detailed reports” help clients maximize efficiency
jumio.com
. Trulioo’s workflow platform, for example, offers “real-time analytics and AI-driven insights” along with detailed workflow reports for analysis and audits
trulioo.com
. This implies the portal logs every verification attempt and decision, and clients can retrieve that data to satisfy auditors or regulators (proving they are KYC compliant, for instance). Overall, rich analytics turn the portal from a configuration tool into a continuous improvement tool. By reviewing these dashboards and reports, the business customer can understand how well their verification process is working, see where fraudsters are challenging them, and adjust their workflow rules accordingly. It fosters a data-driven approach to managing fraud and onboarding: try a rule, measure the outcome, refine as needed.
Account Management and Usage Monitoring
Beyond verification-specific functions, the customer portal should provide a section for account and subscription management. This gives the client transparency into their usage of the identity verification service and other administrative details. Key information and features here include:
Usage Metrics & Quota: The client should be able to see how many verification transactions they have used, typically relative to their plan or quota. For example, if their contract includes 10,000 ID checks per month or a certain number of credits, the portal can show “You have used 7,500 out of 10,000 verifications this month.” A progress bar or usage percentage is helpful. This ensures the customer is aware of their consumption and can avoid surprise overages. In platforms with credit-based pricing, showing remaining credits and their expiration (if any) is useful. Jumio’s portal highlights usage statistics as part of its analytics, letting users easily spot how their transaction volume is trending
jumio.com
.
Billing and Contract Info: Important account info such as the renewal date of the contract, next billing date, or contract end date should be visible. The portal might say “Contract valid until Dec 31, 2025” or “Your annual subscription will renew on Jan 1”. Additionally, if the service has tiers or add-on usage (like a certain number of free verifications and then pay-per-use), the billing section should break down any billable overages or additional services used. Some systems might integrate invoices or at least link to the billing portal from here.
Plan Management: If the provider allows self-service upgrades or purchasing additional verifications, the portal could provide that functionality. For example, “Purchase more verifications” or “Upgrade Plan” links can be present if the client is approaching their limit and might need an immediate top-up. However, in many B2B cases, this might simply direct them to contact their account manager.
User Management and Permissions: The account section may also let the client manage who from their organization can access the portal. For security, there might be user roles (Admin, Analyst, Viewer, etc.) that the primary admin can assign. Here they can invite new team members or remove access for former employees. While not directly about verifications, this feature is important for enterprise readiness and aligns with security best practices.
API and Integration Settings: If the client uses an API to integrate the verification service in their app, the portal might display their API keys, webhooks, and other integration settings in an account section or a dedicated developer settings page. They should be able to regenerate credentials, see logs of API usage, etc., but with appropriate security (maybe only certain roles can view API keys). This ensures the portal is the one-stop-shop for all configuration, not just the workflow rules but also the technical integration info.
All these account management features increase transparency and control for the customer. They won’t have to dig through emails or contracts to find out their usage or when they need to renew – the portal keeps that at their fingertips. This also reduces strain on the provider’s support, since customers can self-serve a lot of these questions.
Data Privacy and Retention Controls
Given that identity verification deals with highly sensitive personal data (IDs, biometric info, etc.), the portal must include robust privacy and data retention features. Business customers often have obligations under regulations like GDPR (in Europe) or CCPA (in California) to protect user data, honor deletion requests, and minimize how long data is kept. The portal should empower customers to manage these aspects:
Data Retention Policies: The platform should allow each client to configure how long personal data from verifications is stored. Some organizations may want to purge data as soon as possible, while others (for audit or compliance reasons) might store it for a defined period (e.g. 30 days, 5 years) as allowed by law. Ideally, the provider gives options or sliders in the portal: for example, “Store verification data for: 1 month / 6 months / 1 year / custom”. Enterprise customers can customize data retention policies based on their business needs
jumio.com
. Jumio explicitly notes that it has controls to ensure data that is no longer needed is discarded timely, and allows clients to set strict retention periods in line with GDPR’s data minimization principle
jumio.com
. In the portal, after the chosen retention period, data (like ID images, videos, personal info) would be automatically deleted. The interface should clearly warn about the implications (e.g. “Deleted data cannot be reviewed or recovered”
docs.jumio.com
).
Manual Deletion (Right to Erasure): Apart from automatic retention, the client should be able to manually trigger deletion of an individual’s data when required. For instance, if a user contacts the client and requests their data to be deleted (exercising GDPR’s Right to Erasure or CCPA deletion right), the client can locate that user’s record or verification session in the portal and delete the personal data associated with it. The portal should provide a search or identifier to find the transaction (maybe via username or verification ID) and a delete option. The ability to delete any data captured during the verification process is a must
jumio.com
. In fact, Jumio assures that it “has the ability to delete any data captured during the online identity verification process, including ID images, biometric information, and selfie images”, and business customers can even set data to be deleted automatically after a verification decision is made
jumio.com
. This level of control is crucial for compliance. The portal should log these deletions as well (so the client has evidence that they honored a deletion request).
Privacy and Consent Settings: If the verification flows require end-user consent for certain data uses (for example, biometric consent notices, or region-specific privacy notices), the portal might allow the client to configure these. This could be as simple as uploading a custom privacy notice text that is shown to users, or toggling certain features to comply with local laws (for instance, disabling face recognition in regions where it’s restricted). While the actual consent capture might happen in the end-user interface, the portal is where the client would manage the content and settings. Moreover, the portal can provide templates or guidance for compliance (like informing them of new regulations that might require a change in workflow or consent).
Security and Access Control: Though more on the backend side, it’s worth noting that the portal should implement strong security measures (two-factor authentication for portal users, IP restriction, etc.) to protect the sensitive data accessible. From a design perspective, features like role-based access (as mentioned in account management and case management) ensure that only authorized personnel can view personal data, which helps maintain compliance with privacy principles of data minimization.
In summary, the customer portal must not only enable effective fraud prevention but also embed privacy by design. By giving clients the tools to control data retention and deletion, it ensures that using the identity verification service will not conflict with their obligations to protect user data. Compliance features like these (GDPR/CCPA toggles, audit logs, configurable retention) are often key selling points for enterprise customers. They need to be confident that integrating this solution will keep them on the right side of laws and user trust. The portal, therefore, should clearly communicate and allow control over how data is stored and cleaned up, offering peace of mind alongside its fraud-fighting capabilities

Conclusion
Designing a customer portal for an identity verification platform involves balancing powerful functionality with ease of use. The business clients using this portal should feel in control: able to tailor verification workflows to their exact needs, pick and choose from a rich set of verification signals, and set the rules that determine outcomes. At the same time, they rely on the provider’s advanced technology – AI risk scoring, document verification, fraud signals – to do the heavy lifting in the background. A well-designed portal will surface those capabilities in a user-friendly way, for example through an intuitive workflow editor and clear risk score visuals. We’ve outlined features from workflow orchestration (dynamic, risk-based flows) and signal configuration (phone, device, document, sanctions checks, etc.) to case management for handling tricky verifications, and analytics dashboards that inform continuous improvement. Real-world platforms like Jumio, Onfido, Trulioo, and Persona already exemplify many of these features: Jumio’s unified portal offers one-stop orchestration with 800+ rules and a combined risk score trigger

helpnetsecurity.com
trulioo.com
; Persona’s case management shows how collaboration and custom review workflows can be handled within the portal
withpersona.com
withpersona.com
. By leveraging such best practices, our customer portal can give clients an end-to-end command center for digital identity verification. Finally, thinking creatively, we can continue to expand the portal’s value: perhaps introducing community or network fraud intelligence (benchmarking data or a fraud feed of known bad actors), AI suggestions for optimizing the workflow (e.g. “rule recommendation engines”), or quality feedback loops where the system learns from manual reviews to improve the AI. But even with the fundamental features described above, the portal will significantly enhance the customer’s ability to manage risk. It transforms identity verification from a black-box vendor service into a transparent, customizable, and insight-rich process that the customer steers – aligning perfectly with the need to fight fraud, ensure compliance, and provide a smooth experience for legitimate users.
