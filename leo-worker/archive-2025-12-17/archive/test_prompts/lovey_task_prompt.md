# LoveyTasks - Family Task Assigner with AI Love Notes

Create a family task management app called "LoveyTasks" that transforms mundane task assignments into loving, flattering, and sometimes funny messages using AI.

## Core Concept
When family members assign tasks to each other, the app uses AI to rewrite the task description into a loving, personalized message that maintains the task details but adds warmth, humor, and appreciation.

## Key Features

### 1. User Management
- Family account creation with multiple family members
- Each member has a profile with:
  - Name
  - Relationship role (Mom, Dad, Son, Daughter, Partner, etc.)
  - Profile picture
  - Personality preferences (formal, playful, romantic, funny)
  - Message style preferences (over-the-top romantic, dad jokes, gen-z slang, shakespearean, etc.)

### 2. Task Creation & Assignment
- Create tasks with:
  - Original/plain description
  - Assignee (family member)
  - Due date/time
  - Priority (High, Medium, Low)
  - Category (Household, Kids, Shopping, Work, Personal)
- AI automatically transforms the message based on:
  - Who's assigning (sender's personality)
  - Who's receiving (recipient's preferences)
  - Task category and urgency
  - Time of day
  - Previous interaction patterns

### 3. AI Message Transformation Examples
- Original: "Take out the trash"
  - Transformed: "My dearest life partner, would you grace our humble abode with your strength and valor by escorting our refuse to its appointed destination? Your dedication to our castle's cleanliness fills my heart with joy! 💕"

- Original: "Pick up milk"
  - Transformed: "Hey superstar! 🌟 Your mission, should you choose to accept it: acquire the sacred white nectar (aka milk) from the store. The kids' cereal bowls await your heroic return! You're the best! 🥛"

- Original: "Clean your room"
  - Transformed (to teen): "Yo kiddo! Your personal space is giving 'tornado aftermath' vibes 🌪️. Time to level up and show that room who's boss! I believe in your organizational powers! 💪"

### 4. Task Response Features
- Recipients can:
  - Accept with a loving response (also AI-enhanced)
  - Negotiate with a counter-offer
  - Mark as complete with a celebration message
  - Add progress updates with encouraging AI responses

### 5. Family Dashboard

- "Surprise Me" - random extra-sweet messages for special occasions
- "Passive Aggressive Mode" (hidden feature) - for when you really need to assign dishwasher duty

### 7. Notification System
