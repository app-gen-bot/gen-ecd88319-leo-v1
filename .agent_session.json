The task has been **completed** - the ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md file exists and is comprehensive (566 lines).\n\nThe changelog shows:\n- User requested: \"Ultrathink and thoroughly explore this codebase... Document your findings in a markdown file at `docs/ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md`\"\n- Summary: \"I've completed a comprehensive architecture analysis...\"\n- Git status: \"nothing to commit, working tree clean\" with ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md in recent changes\n\nThe documentation task is DONE. Now I need to determine the next logical step. Since this was an exploration/documentation task that's complete, the agent should:\n\n1. Verify the work is complete\n2. Ask what the user wants to do next OR wait for new instructions\n\n**RESUME MODE TASK COMPLETED** - The original intent (explore codebase, document findings) has been satisfied.\n\nArchitecture analysis complete \u2713 (566-line doc at `docs/ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md`). Git clean, no pending work.\n\nThe exploration task is DONE. Key findings documented:\n\u2022 leo-web/leo-worker architecture + WSI protocol\n\u2022 Iteration loop + reprompter flow\n\u2022 Skills system + prompt configuration\n\u2022 Pain points (WSI client complexity, dual repos)\n\n**Next**: Await new instructions from user. If user provides a new task, enter RESUME mode with written TASK_PLAN. If user wants improvements based on findings (e.g., \"refactor WSI client\" or \"fix the pain points\"), delegate to **research** \u2192 **code** \u2192 **quality_assurer** pipeline.",
