The context shows:\n- RESUME MODE TASK COMPLETED \u2713 \n- Git is clean\n- The plan has 5 open questions (Q1-Q5) documented\n\nLooking at the changelog and context, the planning/research phase is DONE. The next logical step is to either:\n1. Wait for user input on the 5 open questions before implementing\n2. Or proceed with implementation using the recommendations in the plan\n\nGiven the master plan guidance for RESUME mode - the original request was to \"research and write a plan\" (NOT implement), that task is complete. However, the practical next step would be to confirm the open questions or start implementation.\n\n**RESUME MODE TASK COMPLETED \u2713** - User role plan documented (398 lines). Git clean.\n\nPlan covers 5 phases: data model \u2192 friendly logs \u2192 visibility \u2192 UI gating \u2192 testing. Has 5 open questions with recommendations. Code paths identified for all changes.\n\n**Next**: Await user decision on open questions (Q1-Q5 in plan) OR start Phase 1 implementation if user approves recommendations. When ready to implement, delegate **code** for Phase 1 (schema + `user_plus` role + `app_assignments` table), run migration, then **quality_assurer** to verify. Each phase follows code \u2192 test pipeline.",
